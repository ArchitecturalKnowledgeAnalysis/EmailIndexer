# EmailIndexer
Utility for generating Lucene indexed datasets for collections of emails.

## Dataset Structure

The datasets generated by this library are structured simply as a directory containing multiple files and/or subdirectories:

- The `index` directory contains all files used by Apache Lucene for creating and searching over indexes.
- The `database.mv.db` file is the self-contained H2 relational database that contains all emails and any associated tags.
