# EmailIndexer
Utility for generating Lucene indexed datasets for collections of emails, and provides a browser application for browsing and interacting with datasets.

## Setup
Simply download the latest available JAR file via the **Releases** section of this GitHub repository, and run it. The email dataset browser application will open to an empty interface.

**Note**: Java version 17 or higher is required to run this program.

To start analyzing some emails, you can either:
- Generate a new dataset
- Open an existing dataset, via `File > Open Dataset`. You may open datasets from directories, or from compressed ZIP files; in the latter case, the zip file will be unzipped to a directory.

## Generating a Dataset

Datasets are generated by processing one or more directories containing `.mbox` files. After clicking `File > Generate Dataset`, you'll see the above dialog, where you can specify one or more directories to process. If you don't yet have any mbox files, you may click `Download Emails` to open a simple dialog where you can download mbox files from Apache's API by specifying the mailing list name, domain, and a directory to download to. You can browse available mail archives on the [Apache Mail Archives site](https://lists.apache.org/).

Finally, select a directory to generate the dataset in, via the `Generate to` field.

Once you click `Generate`, the mbox files will be parsed to generate a dataset consisting of Lucene index files and an H2 database file, in the specified directory.
