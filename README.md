# EmailIndexer
Utility for generating Lucene indexed datasets for collections of emails, and provides a browser application for browsing and interacting with datasets.

## Setup
Simply download the latest available JAR file via the **Releases** section of this GitHub repository, and run it. The email dataset browser application will open to an empty interface.

**Note**: Java version 17 or higher is required to run this program.

To start analyzing some emails, you can either:
- Generate a new dataset
- Open an existing dataset, via `File > Open Dataset`. You may open datasets from directories, or from compressed ZIP files; in the latter case, the zip file will be unzipped to a directory.
