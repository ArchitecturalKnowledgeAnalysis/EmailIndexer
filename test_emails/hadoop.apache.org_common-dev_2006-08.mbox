close method in a Mapper should be provided with OutputCollector and a Reporter
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                 Key: HADOOP-403
                 URL: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-403
             Project: Hadoop
          Issue Type: Improvement
          Components: mapred
    Affects Versions: 0.5.0
         Environment: all
            Reporter: Milind Bhandarkar
         Assigned To: Milind Bhandarkar
             Fix For: 0.5.0


For mappers with side-effects, or mappers that work as aggregators (i.e. no output on individual key-value pairs, but an aggregate output at the end of all key-value pairs), output should be performed in the close method. For this purpose, we need to supply output collector and reporter to the close method of Mapper. This involves interface change, though. Thoughts ?

Bryan Pendleton commented on HADOOP-403:
----------------------------------------

+1 on this one. Reporter or Progressable objects should be passed into *any* call in this project, but I've also run into the need to output "after all maps", with no hook currently available to do it.

---------------------------------

    Attachment: reflection.patch

This patch provides a util function newInstance. It's an incomplete patch to this bug. Still need to clean up all the factories.

> There seems to be a change that happened between 1.4 and 1.5 with respect to static initializers. I can't find this documented, but I can reproduce with a very simple program. Basically, a static initializer is not called unless a static member/method of the class is accessed or an instance is created. This is actually what the JLS says, but until 1.5 the static initializers ran when the class was loaded. Note that this behavior only occurs when running with the 1.5 JRE AND compiling for 1.5.
> For many Writables this isn't an issue, so the fallback behavior of the WritableFactory works, but Block is package private, so loadEdits fails when called from org.apache.hadoop.io.ArrayWritable.readFields() yielding the following trace:
> Caused by: java.lang.RuntimeException: java.lang.IllegalAccessException: Class org.apache.hadoop.io.WritableFactories can not access a member of class org.apache.hadoop.dfs.Block with modifiers "public"

> - Namenode.sendHeartbeat does not create a throwaway DatanodeDescriptor. DatanodeID is sufficient in this case.
> - DatanodeID is made Writable, and it also implements equals() and hashCode().
> - DatanodeInfo is updated to call base class methods in its implementation of Writable interface.
> - I changed the way strings are written/read using UTF8.writeString and UTF8.readString.

> - Namenode.sendHeartbeat does not create a throwaway DatanodeDescriptor. DatanodeID is sufficient in this case.
> - DatanodeID is made Writable, and it also implements equals() and hashCode().
> - DatanodeInfo is updated to call base class methods in its implementation of Writable interface.
> - I changed the way strings are written/read using UTF8.writeString and UTF8.readString.
> - Some comments are updated.

TestMiniMRLocalFS gets stuck on running the reduce. THe reduce never seems to return. The test kept on running for more than an hour and the reduce never returned. I tried ant test with revision 427236
 which is just before the patch for HADOOP-362, and the tests seemed to work fine. I have not yet diagnozed the problem.

Duplicate browseDirectory.jsp

            Reporter: Konstantin Shvachko
            Priority: Minor
             Fix For: 0.5.0


I found 2 identical files
src\webapps\datanode\browseDirectory.jsp
and
src\webapps\dfs\browseDirectory.jsp

And there is a line in build.xml that makes the copy
    <copy file="${src.webapps}/datanode/browseDirectory.jsp" todir="${src.webapps}/dfs/"/>

That does not seem right. If one of them is a copy of another, then only one should be in svn.
Another thing is that while copying files to the build/ directory is OK, copying files around within
the source directories makes things complicated. Is there a way to avoid that?

Devaraj Das commented on HADOOP-405:
------------------------------------

Yes, the file browseDirectory.jsp need not be there in src\webapps\dfs directory. It is anyway overwritten with a copy from src\webapps\datanode during the build process. Only one copy need to be there in svn.
I think the *.jsp files have to be there in the src\webapps\* directories for the jsp compilation to complete successfully. Not sure whether we can avoid that copying.

Mikkel Kamstrup Erlandsen updated HADOOP-293:
---------------------------------------------

    Attachment: report-error-1.patch

I've had my share of troubles regarding this too. When a task encounters an error, all I see is:

Exception in thread "main" java.io.IOException: Job failed!
        at org.apache.hadoop.mapred.JobClient.runJob(JobClient.java:357)
       ...
        <snip useless info>

I attach a preview patch of my suggestion. It is against 0.4, but I'll forward port it to head and integrate it more with the rest of the system, if the approach is generally accepted by the devs. Please consider the patch as a idea-preview, not as a serious stab at the problem.

The approach is to add a public JobStatus.lastError string, which can be set from any throwable like JobStatus.setLastError(Throwable t). Setting this at relevant places (fx. on errors in mapred.LocalJobRunner.run() as in the patch) is useful for debugging purposes (for me atleast).

Child JVM's don't have access to logging config system properties. When the child JVM gets launched, it doesn't inherit the Java system properties hadoop.log.dir and hadoop.log.file (which are actually based on the Bash environment variables $HADOOP_LOG_DIR and $HADOOP_LOGFILE). This means that you get no log messages from the actual map/reduce tasks that are executing.

Stefan Groschupf reported this problem a while back:

Hi Hadoop developers,

I'm confused about the way logging works within map or reduce tasks.
Since tasks are launched in a new JVM  the java system properties "hadoop.log.dir" and "hadoop.log.file" are not passed to the new JVM.
This prevents the child process from logging properly. In fact you get:

 java.io.FileNotFoundException: / (Is a directory)

We see several ways to solve this problem. First retrieve the properties "hadoop.log.dir" and "hadoop.log.file" from the mother JVM and then pass them to the child JVM as within the args parameter.
Second would be to  access the environment variables "$HADOOP_LOG_DIR" and "$HADOOP_LOGFILE" using System.getEnv (java 1.5).
Third there would be a more general solution. Taskrunner would resolve any environment variables it found in "mapred.child.java.opts" by lookup the value using System.getEnv().
Eg:
unix:
export MAX_MEMORY = 200
hadoop-site.xml:
<name>mapred.child.java.opts</name>
<value>-Xmx${MAX_MEMORY}</value>

Chris Schneider updated HADOOP-406:
-----------------------------------

    Attachment: HADOOP-406.patch

Here's a patch that provides one solution to the problem.

I modified TaskRunner.java so that it supports elements like -Dhadoop.log.dir=@property[hadoop.log.dir]@ within the mapred.child.java.opts Hadoop configuration property (replacing @property[hadoop.log.dir]@ with this property value).

If others agree that this is the appropriate way to solve the problem, then we should probably modify mapred.child.java.opts in hadoop-default.xml to include all 5 of the items in the default $HADOOP_OPTS (hadoop.log.dir, hadoop.log.file, hadoop.home.dir, hadoop.id.str, and hadoop.root.logger), using this method. A few notes, though:

1) This creates yet another dependency on the contents of $HADOOP_OPTS (i.e., anyone that adds items to this should probably add them to mapred.child.java.opts as well.) This is less than elegant.

2) It doesn't seem like hadoop.home.dir, hadoop.id.str, and hadoop.root.logger are actually being used currently by the code. Both hadoop.home.dir and hadoop.id.str are loaded by LogFormatter.initFileHandler(), but that method doesn't seem to be used by anyone. It doesn't seem like anyone is loading hadoop.root.logger at all.

> Child JVM's don't have access to logging config system properties. When the child JVM gets launched, it doesn't inherit the Java system properties hadoop.log.dir and hadoop.log.file (which are actually based on the Bash environment variables $HADOOP_LOG_DIR and $HADOOP_LOGFILE). This means that you get no log messages from the actual map/reduce tasks that are executing.

--------------------------------------

This patch broke the build. In particular, the org.apache.hadoop.mapred.TestMiniMRLocalFS no longer finishes. When the job becomes stuck, the reduces are still running. I assume they are stuck in an infinite loop somewhere.

> I replaced the merge sort with a quick sort and it yielded approx 30% improvement in sort time. It also reduced the memory requirement for sorting because the sort is done in place.

Currently, when the framework is sorting it creates a side thread that sends fake progress reports back to the task tracker once a second. This can cause problems if there is a problem in the sort getting stuck. It would be far better to have the sort take a Progressable that can report that progress is being made in the sort.

> class JobConf (or its base class Configuration) 
> should be extended to enable enumeration of all its key-value pairs.
> ( more precisely: the Properties returned by Configuration.getProps() )
> This will be useful to "export" all JobConf properties to environment variables.
> We use env.vars to expose some Hadoop context to non-Java MapReduce applications.
> Note that the typed properties are also represented as Strings 
> (getInt, getStrings, getClass, etc.)
> So a single enumeration exposes everything as (untyped) environment variables.
> The proposed escaping rules from JobConf properties to env.var are:
> 1. values are left as-is.
> 2. keys are escaped as follows:
> [A-Za-z0-9] --> unchanged.
> all other chars --> underscore.
> For example
> set("mapred.input.key.class", "com.example.MyKey")
> becomes env.var:
> export mapred_input_key_class=com.example.MyKey
> Justification:
> 1. Environment variables are case-sensitive. (Although uppercase is the preferred convention)
>   So no need to uppercase everything.
> 2. Some characters are forbidden in env.vars, or at least not shell-friendly:
> For example period, colon are problematic.
> 3. The Hadoop conventions are already hierarchical and provide some namespace protection.
>    This means we don't need an additional prefix as protection.
>    For example all exported environment variables will start with "mapred." , "dfs." , "ipc." etc.
>   This means they will not conflict with standard environemnt variables like PATH, USER, etc.
>   And they will not conflict with standard hadoop env.vars because those are upper-case. (like HADOOP_CONF_DIR)

> I replaced the merge sort with a quick sort and it yielded approx 30% improvement in sort time. It also reduced the memory requirement for sorting because the sort is done in place.

             Project: Hadoop
          Issue Type: Wish
    Affects Versions: 0.4.0
            Reporter: Doug Cutting
            Priority: Minor


Several of the unit tests take over a minute to run.  I suspect most of this time is waiting for daemons to stop.  Perhaps we can restructure daemon shutdown in the test frameworks so that all daemons are first asked to shutdown, and then wait for the actual shutdown of all daemons in the TestCase's tearDown() method.  Also, we might try to combine some unit tests that require the same daemons under a single TestCase caller, so that they share setup/tearDown costs.  Or we could try to simply make daemon shutdowns faster.

Doug Cutting commented on HADOOP-398:
-------------------------------------

+1

I would name the "utils" package "common" or something instead, since "util" might imply it's for users.

Should we also move the input & output format implementations to an "io" package, or to the "lib" package?

> I propose the following splits:
> org.apache.hadoop.mapred = client API
> org.apache.hadoop.mapred.task = code for task tracker
> org.apache.hadoop.mapred.job = code for job tracker
> org.apache.hadoop.mapred.utils = non public code that is shared between the servers
> Does anyone have any other divisions that would help?
> I would make the classes sent through RPC public classes in the server's package.
> Thoughts?

> This patch implements Owen's comments to HADOOP-321. Namely,
> - Namenode.sendHeartbeat does not create a throwaway DatanodeDescriptor. DatanodeID is sufficient in this case.
> - DatanodeID is made Writable, and it also implements equals() and hashCode().
> - DatanodeInfo is updated to call base class methods in its implementation of Writable interface.
> - I changed the way strings are written/read using UTF8.writeString and UTF8.readString.
> - Some comments are updated.

> I have a couple of comments on HADOOP-375. Sorry missed that discussion when the patch was under construction.
> 1) As it is done now infoPort is a member of two classes DatanodeInfo and DatanodeRegistration, which in fact have a
> common base DatanodeID. It seems more logical to place infoPort into DatanodeID. This will let us handle the port
> assignments inside the constructors rather than outside, and will prevent from unsafe "dynamic casts" like the one
> found in FSNamesystem.gotHeartbeat( DatanodeID nodeID, ... )
>             nodeinfo.infoPort = ((DatanodeRegistration)nodeID).infoPort;
> 2) Also, should we make infoPort short rather than integer?
> Since it is a part of a heartbeat message we might want keeping it small.
> 3) Member getters should start with get<MemberName>
> - public int infoPort() { return infoPort; }
> + public int getInfoPort() { return infoPort; }

> A couple of improvements requested:
> * change the title of the namenode page to include namenode
>     Hadoop Administration
>     -> Hadoop NameNode (<host>:<port>)
> * Move all the info except the per node info from the dfshealth.jsp page to the home page.  No reason to make folks go through that page to get summary info or to find local logs.
> * It would  be good if the health status information were sorted by node name, rather than the (random) order that -report returns
> * Looking at an xml file copied to the dfs, can't view/tail it in the browser. Can download the file and view it locally.
> * Viewing a java source file, the newlines don't come out right. Again, downloading and viewing locally is fine.
> * When clicking on a file, it would be good to view its contents (or some subset of it) immediately, with the advanced options appearing at the bottom (block locations [just choose one], number of blocks view/tail/download/chunk size).
> * Fix the filename problem (browser related) [e.g. /user/yarnon/build.xml gets translated to -user-yarnon-build.xml]

Doug Cutting commented on HADOOP-405:
-------------------------------------

I agree with Konstantin: the build should not modify anything in the src tree.

Instead of the copy, you can add <jspcompile jspfiles="../browseDirectory.jsp" .../>.

> This patch implements Owen's comments to HADOOP-321. Namely,
> - Namenode.sendHeartbeat does not create a throwaway DatanodeDescriptor. DatanodeID is sufficient in this case.
> - DatanodeID is made Writable, and it also implements equals() and hashCode().
> - DatanodeInfo is updated to call base class methods in its implementation of Writable interface.
> - I changed the way strings are written/read using UTF8.writeString and UTF8.readString.
> - Some comments are updated.

> class JobConf (or its base class Configuration) 
> should be extended to enable enumeration of all its key-value pairs.
> ( more precisely: the Properties returned by Configuration.getProps() )
> This will be useful to "export" all JobConf properties to environment variables.
> We use env.vars to expose some Hadoop context to non-Java MapReduce applications.
> Note that the typed properties are also represented as Strings 
> (getInt, getStrings, getClass, etc.)
> So a single enumeration exposes everything as (untyped) environment variables.
> The proposed escaping rules from JobConf properties to env.var are:
> 1. values are left as-is.
> 2. keys are escaped as follows:
> [A-Za-z0-9] --> unchanged.
> all other chars --> underscore.
> For example
> set("mapred.input.key.class", "com.example.MyKey")
> becomes env.var:
> export mapred_input_key_class=com.example.MyKey
> Justification:
> 1. Environment variables are case-sensitive. (Although uppercase is the preferred convention)
>   So no need to uppercase everything.
> 2. Some characters are forbidden in env.vars, or at least not shell-friendly:
> For example period, colon are problematic.
> 3. The Hadoop conventions are already hierarchical and provide some namespace protection.
>    This means we don't need an additional prefix as protection.
>    For example all exported environment variables will start with "mapred." , "dfs." , "ipc." etc.
>   This means they will not conflict with standard environemnt variables like PATH, USER, etc.
>   And they will not conflict with standard hadoop env.vars because those are upper-case. (like HADOOP_CONF_DIR)

> Since we use the hadoop output in non-hadoop applications it's nice to be able to merge the part-files into one output file on the local filesystem.

> * change the title of the namenode page to include namenode
>     Hadoop Administration
>     -> Hadoop NameNode (<host>:<port>)
> * Move all the info except the per node info from the dfshealth.jsp page to the home page.  No reason to make folks go through that page to get summary info or to find local logs.
> * It would  be good if the health status information were sorted by node name, rather than the (random) order that -report returns
> * Looking at an xml file copied to the dfs, can't view/tail it in the browser. Can download the file and view it locally.
> * Viewing a java source file, the newlines don't come out right. Again, downloading and viewing locally is fine.
> * When clicking on a file, it would be good to view its contents (or some subset of it) immediately, with the advanced options appearing at the bottom (block locations [just choose one], number of blocks view/tail/download/chunk size).
> * Fix the filename problem (browser related) [e.g. /user/yarnon/build.xml gets translated to -user-yarnon-build.xml]

Using HashMap instead of TreeMap for some maps in Namenode yields 17% performance improvement
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                 URL: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-410
             Project: Hadoop
          Issue Type: Improvement

         Environment: linux

             Fix For: 0.5.0
         Attachments: hashmap.patch

For blocksMap in FSNameSystem and activeBlocks map in FSDirectory, if we use HashMap instead of TreeMap, it yields 17% performance improvement (without significant difference in memory consumption).
I am attaching a patch, alongwith a namenode benchmark.

Milind Bhandarkar commented on HADOOP-403:
------------------------------------------

I just checked that this can be done without changing the mapper interface. We can hang the Reporter and OutputCollector off of JobConf which is passed to configure method. I will attach a patch soon.

> For mappers with side-effects, or mappers that work as aggregators (i.e. no output on individual key-value pairs, but an aggregate output at the end of all key-value pairs), output should be performed in the close method. For this purpose, we need to supply output collector and reporter to the close method of Mapper. This involves interface change, though. Thoughts ?

          Issue Type: New Feature
            Reporter: Hairong Kuang
         Assigned To: Hairong Kuang


Sometimes a map/red job only wants to work on a subset of input data for the needs of its apllication or at the debugging phase. It would be convenient if an input format transparently handles this. It should provide an API that allows a programmer to specify a filtering criteria.

Hairong Kuang updated HADOOP-412:
---------------------------------

    Attachment: filter.patch

This patch provides class SequenceFileInputFilter that can feed a subset of sequence file records to map tasks.  It provides a class method setFilter that defines a flltering criteria.

The patch provides three Filters: RegexFilter, PercentFilter, and MD5Filter. But a programmer may define its own filter. Any user-defined filter should either implements interface Filter or extend from FilterBase.

A junit test is also included.

replace class UTF8 with class Text

            Reporter: Hairong Kuang
         Assigned To: Hairong Kuang
             Fix For: 0.4.0


Since class UTF8 is deprecated, all references of UTF8 in hadoop should be replaced with class Text if the change does not break the system.

            Reporter: Konstantin Shvachko
             Fix For: 0.5.0


HADOOP-392 introduced a new TreeMap member (datanodeMapByName) in the name node.
It is used solely for reporting the data nodes in the UI sorted by their names.
I think it is quite inefficient both time and space-wise to support an excessive
data structure just for that.
Suppose the UI will also require sorting by last heartbeat and/or by the available space....
I think DFSNodesStatus() should just sort the original datanodeMap before returning the list.

          Issue Type: Bug
          Components: mapred
            Reporter: Michel Tourn


Web UI JSP: need to HTML-Escape log (file) contents

Displaying the task's error log or the mapred.Reporter status String:

the content should 
have all "<" and ">" converted to "&lt;" and "&gt;", 
or use "<pre>" tag. 
Otherwise, ant HTML/XML tags within will not be displayed correctly

This problem occurs for ex. when using hadoopStreaming and 
a MapRed record is a chunk of HTML/XML content (and a task fails)

ex. problematic view:
http://jobtracker:50030/taskdetails.jsp?jobid=job_0009&taskid=tip_0009_m_000000
Other jsp pages may also need a change.

Marco Nicosia commented on HADOOP-417:
--------------------------------------

I realize it may be premature to file this, there are newer versions of Jetty5 we could try first. But it seems from the mortbay site, that even though Jetty6 has only gone GA pretty recently, they're really pushing it. I expect we'll have to upgrade sooner or later, hence the bug.

> Hadoop commands should all support some common options.  For example, it should be possible to specify the namenode, datanode, and, for that matter, any config option, in a generic way.
> This could be implemented with code like:
> public interface Tool extends Configurable {
>   void run(String[] args) throws Exception;
> }
> public class ToolBase implements Tool extends Configured {
>   public final void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
>     Configuration conf = new Configuration();
>     ... parse config options from args into conf ...
>     this.configure(conf);
>     this.run();
>   }
> }
> public MyTool extends ExcecutableBase {
>   public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
>     new MyTool().main(args);
>   }
> }
> The general command line syntax could be:
> bin/hadoop [generalOptions] command [commandOptions]
> Where generalOptions are things that ToolBase handles, and only the commandOptions are passed to Tool.run().  The most important generalOption would be '-D', which would define name/value pairs that are set in the configuration.  This alone would permit folks to set the namenode, datanode, etc.

Doug Cutting updated HADOOP-414:
--------------------------------

        Fix Version/s: 0.6.0
                           (was: 0.4.0)
    Affects Version/s: 0.5.0
                           (was: 0.4.0)

I think we should target this for 0.6, and just deprecate UTF8 in 0.5.  Does that make sense?

> Since class UTF8 is deprecated, all references of UTF8 in hadoop should be replaced with class Text if the change does not break the system.

> Sometimes a map/red job only wants to work on a subset of input data for the needs of its apllication or at the debugging phase. It would be convenient if an input format transparently handles this. It should provide an API that allows a programmer to specify a filtering criteria.

I committed the reflection patch, but am not yet closing this.

Hairong, will you provide a patch replacing WritableFactory with ReflectionUtils?

> There seems to be a change that happened between 1.4 and 1.5 with respect to static initializers. I can't find this documented, but I can reproduce with a very simple program. Basically, a static initializer is not called unless a static member/method of the class is accessed or an instance is created. This is actually what the JLS says, but until 1.5 the static initializers ran when the class was loaded. Note that this behavior only occurs when running with the 1.5 JRE AND compiling for 1.5.
> For many Writables this isn't an issue, so the fallback behavior of the WritableFactory works, but Block is package private, so loadEdits fails when called from org.apache.hadoop.io.ArrayWritable.readFields() yielding the following trace:

We'd like to accumulate the statistics (and get graphs) at the job level rather than the job level, because it will provide a lot more useful information. This likely implies that they need to be rolled up in the TaskStatus reported up to the JobTracker.

Paul,
   Is this still happening with the http map output transfer or can I close this?

> MapOutputProtocol connections cause timeouts because of system thrashing and transferring the same file over and over again, ultimately leading to making no forward progress(medium sized job, 500GB input file, map output about as large as the input, 10 node cluster).
> There are several bugs behind this, but the following two changes improved matters considerably.
> (1) 
> The buffersize in MapOutputFile is currently hardcoded to 8192 bytes (for both reads and writes). By changing this buffer size to 256KB, the number of disk seeks are reduced and the problem went away. 
> Ideally there would be a buffer size parameter for this that is separate from the DFS io buffer size.
> (2)
> I also added the following code to the socket configuration in both Server.java and Client.java. No linger is a minor good idea in an enivronment with some packet loss (and you will have that when all the nodes get busy at once), but 256KB buffers is probably excessive, especially on a LAN, but it takes me two hours to test changes so I havent experimented.
> socket.setSendBufferSize(256*1024);
> socket.setReceiveBufferSize(256*1024);
> socket.setSoLinger(false, 0);
> socket.setKeepAlive(true);

Owen O'Malley commented on HADOOP-403:
--------------------------------------

I'm very uncomfortable with passing the Reporter and OutputCollector via the JobConf.

It does two bad things:
  1. It passes "real" Java objects around in the JobConf, which breaks the assumption that the JobConf can be serialized successfully. (In this case, it is ok because it won't cross the process boundary, but it breaks the developers expectations.)
  2. It hides the information that application writers need in a very hidden place. If I look at Mapper or Reducer, I won't see the information that I have available. Only if I scan through the HUGE JobConf API will I see the fact that they are avaiable.

I strongly suggest that we just take the hit and extend the Closeable interface. I'd propose:
  1. Making the Closeable.close() method depricated.
  2. Add a new Closeable.close(OutputCollector, Reporter) method.
  3. In MapReduceBase provide a default implementation that calls the close() method.

That should minimize the breakage in user code and still make the intended interface clear.

> For mappers with side-effects, or mappers that work as aggregators (i.e. no output on individual key-value pairs, but an aggregate output at the end of all key-value pairs), output should be performed in the close method. For this purpose, we need to supply output collector and reporter to the close method of Mapper. This involves interface change, though. Thoughts ?

----------------------------------------

Don't know what the culprits are, but here are two stack traces I got today that killed a 2-hour job. Maybe, for now, validateUTF should be called when first serializing, too. There seem to still be a few bugs in how Text handles content.

> Just to verify, which length-encoding scheme are we using for class Text (aka LargeUTF8) 
> a) The "UTF-8/Lucene" scheme? (highest bit of each byte is an extension bit, which I think is what Doug is describing in his last comment) or 
> b) the record-IO scheme in o.a.h.record.Utils.java:readInt 
> Either way, note that: 
> 1. UTF8.java and its successor Text.java need to read the length in two ways: 
>   1a. consume 1+ bytes from a DataInput and 
>   1b. parse the length within a byte array at a given offset 
> (1.b is used for the "WritableComparator optimized for UTF8 keys" ). 
> o.a.h.record.Utils only supports the DataInput mode. 
> It is not clear to me what is the best way to extend this Utils code when you need to support both reading modes 
> 2 Methods like UTF8's WritableComparator are to be low overhead, in partic. there should be no Object allocation. 
> For the byte array case, the varlen-reader utility needs to be extended to return both: 
>  the decoded length and the length of the encoded length. 
>  (so that the caller can do offset += encodedlength) 
>     
> 3. A String length does not need (small) negative integers. 
> 4. One advantage of a) is that it is standard (or at least well-known and natural) and there are no magic constants (like -120, -121 -124)

Konstantin Shvachko commented on HADOOP-415:
--------------------------------------------

Actually, I think that it would be even better to make DFSNodesStatus() a member of the JspHelper  class.
And sorting should be called directly in the jsp file.
In general it would be good to keep all data collection/processing in the JspHelper class,
and let the jsp-files just output information.

> HADOOP-392 introduced a new TreeMap member (datanodeMapByName) in the name node.
> It is used solely for reporting the data nodes in the UI sorted by their names.
> I think it is quite inefficient both time and space-wise to support an excessive
> data structure just for that.
> Suppose the UI will also require sorting by last heartbeat and/or by the available space....
> I think DFSNodesStatus() should just sort the original datanodeMap before returning the list.

-----------------------------------------

I agree, it seems reasonable practice to deprecate the class in 0.5 and give people enough time to prepare for removal.

This is the error I am getting when running ant test on TestLocalDFS.
Its the same error (version mismatch) for TestMiniMRWithDFS.

> The namespace information (image and transaction logs) needs to be replicated on hosts other than the namenode to prevent data loss if a namenode crashes. In the short term we will add a new protocol to the datanodes to receive and store the namespace information.
> In the long term, it would be nice to have read-only namenodes that could receive the information and serve it up for users that want to read data, but do not need to write to the namespace.

Sanjay Dahiya commented on HADOOP-263:
--------------------------------------

Here is what I am thinking for this. 

We add an extra field (timestamp) in org.apache.hadoop.mapred.TaskStatus. The timestamp gets TaskTracker.TaskInprogress.reportProgress(), when a task reports progress. As part of Task the timestamp is updated in Progress.set(), Progress.setStatus() and complete(). The timestamp is sent over to TaskTracker over RPC along with status.

Another option is to update the timestamp when TaskTracker gets the progress report, without making any change to the Task. But sending timestamp over RPC gives a more accurate timestamp of the last progress update.

Devaraj Das updated HADOOP-415:
-------------------------------

    Attachment: refactor_nodestatus.patch

Agree with this. Attached is the patch. In dfshealth.jsp, I also changed the DatanodeInfo references to DatanodeDescriptor to reflect the current code.

> HADOOP-392 introduced a new TreeMap member (datanodeMapByName) in the name node.
> It is used solely for reporting the data nodes in the UI sorted by their names.
> I think it is quite inefficient both time and space-wise to support an excessive
> data structure just for that.
> Suppose the UI will also require sorting by last heartbeat and/or by the available space....
> I think DFSNodesStatus() should just sort the original datanodeMap before returning the list.

Owen O'Malley updated HADOOP-400:
---------------------------------

           Status: Patch Available  (was: Open)
    Fix Version/s: 0.6.0
       Attachment: task-schedule.patch

This patch does:
  1. It limits each TaskTracker to running
        min(tasksPerTracker, ceil(tasksLeftToRun/numTaskTrackers))
      this will prevent the problem that we saw where the last 2 reduces scheduled were put on the same node rather than different empty ones
  2. It refactors obtainNewMapTask and obtainNewReduceTask to call a common utility function. It also replaces the two parallel loops with one.
  3. Only allowed tasks that have failed on this task tracker to run if we have exhausted the cluster.

> The job tracker tries not to run tasks that have previously failed on a node on that node again, but it doesn't strictly prevent it.
> I propose to change the rule so that when pollForNewTask is called by a TaskTracker, the JobTracker will only assign it a task that has failed on that TaskTracker, if and only if it has already failed on the entire cluster. Thus, for "normal" clusters with more than 4 TaskTrackers, you will be guaranteed that it will run on 4 different TaskTrackers. For small clusters, it will run on every TaskTracker in the cluster at least once.
> Does that sound reasonable to everyone?

    Affects Version/s: 0.4.0
                           (was: 0.2.0)

Here's a fix to make "fsck" count over/under replicated blocks according to the per-file value, rather than the global one.

> 1. We need to adjust Dfsck to the new per-file replication feature.
> fsck checks block replication based on the configured global replication parameter.
> Which is now just the default. The actual file replication is returned in DFSFileInfo.
> So at least the reporting is screwed by that, although I didn't check what will happen with
> other options -move and -delete.
> 2. fsck throws NullPointerException if you type
> bin/hadoop fsck -files /doc
> instead of
> bin/hadoop fsck /doc -files
> 3. Unfortunately, there are several commands that throw different kinds of Exceptions
> rather than at least printing the usage info, when some of its arguments are missing or
> misplaced. ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is one them. Try
> bin/hadoop dfs -mv
> bin/hadoop dfs -cp
> bin/hadoop dfs -rm
> 4. In general the shell is growing and getting more sophisticated.
> Should we work out a general convention on how the parameters should be structured, named,
> short/long version of the keywords, help, etc.

Konstantin Shvachko commented on HADOOP-415:
--------------------------------------------

DatanodeDescriptor is supposed to be used only be the namenode internally.
The class for external use is DatanodeInfo. See HADOOP-321.
That is why DatanodeInfo is public and DatanodeDescriptor is not.
So using DatanodeInfo in dfshealth.jsp was actually right.
I should add some comments in JavaDoc on that.

-------------------------------

    Attachment: refactor_nodestatus.patch

Well, that should be okay since the jsp file actually belongs to the dfs package. But in any case, I have attached a new patch with the DatanodeDescriptor changes reverted.

mapreduce jobs fail when no split is returned via inputFormat.getSplits
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

                 Key: HADOOP-424
                 URL: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-424
             Project: Hadoop
          Issue Type: Bug
          Components: mapred
    Affects Versions: 0.4.0
            Reporter: Fr=C3=A9d=C3=A9ric Bertin


I'm using a MapReduce job to process some data logged and timestamped into =
files.
When the job runs, it does not process the whole data, but filters only the=
 data that has been logged since the last job run.

However, when no new data has been logged, the job fails because the getSpl=
its method of InputFormat returns no split. Thus the number of map tasks is=
 0. This is not intercepted, and the job fails at reduce step because it se=
ems it does not find any data to process:

java.io.FileNotFoundException: /local/home/hadoop/var/mapred/local/task_003=
0_r_000000_3/all.2 at org.apache.hadoop.fs.LocalFileSystem.openRaw(LocalFil=

he.hadoop.mapred.ReduceTask.run(ReduceTask.java:241) at org.apache.hadoop.m=
apred.TaskTracker$Child.main(TaskTracker.java:1013)

What should be Hadoop's behaviour in such a case?

IMHO, the job should be considered as successful. Indeed, this is not a job=
 failure, but just a lack of input data. WDYT?

Uros Gruber commented on HADOOP-307:
------------------------------------

I want to try this on Windows with cygwin and found some problems.

1. $JAVA_HOME in run.sh needs to be "$JAVA_HOME" because on windows java is installed in Program Files and there is problem with spaces
2. also there is some /export/crawlspace/kryptonite/java/jdk/lib/tools.jar in classpath which I believe is not needed.

also with this I could not get script working with error

java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/hadoop/benchmarks/mapred/MultiJobRunner

If I have only ./classes in my classpath there is problem with loger. I don't know If there is any problem with classpath definition in windows.

> A benchmark that runs many small MapReduce tasks in sequence. A single map reduce implementation is used, it is invoked multiple times with input as the output from previous run. The input to first Map is a TextInputFormat ( a text file with few hundred KBs). Input records are passed to output without much processing. The idea is to benchmark the time taken by initialization of Mapper and Reducer. An initial prototyping on a single machine with 20 MR tasks in sequence took ~47 seconds per task. Looking for suggestions on what else can be included in the benchmark.

I translated the word count example into python and convert it into a jar using jython. It provides a nice example of writing Hadoop map/reduce programs in python.

I changed the workflow in Jira yesterday, adding a "Patch Available" 
status for issues.  Folks should use this when they believe a patch is 
ready to be reviewed and committed.  The list of issues in this state 
(http://tinyurl.com/lazcw) is the queue of patches for committers to 
review.  So, if you want your patch to get committed, please put it in 
this state.  If a committer judges that an issue in this state is not 
actually ready for commit, then he-or-she should re-open the issue.

Doug

> When a data node disk is almost full the name node still assigns blocks to the data node.
> By the time the data node actually tries to write that data to disk the disk may become full.
> Current implementation forces the data node to shutdown after that.
> The expected behavior is to report the block write failure and continue.
> The Exception looks as follows:
> java.io.IOException: No space left on device
> at java.io.FileOutputStream.writeBytes(Native Method)
> at java.io.FileOutputStream.write(FileOutputStream.java:260)
> at java.io.BufferedOutputStream.flushBuffer(BufferedOutputStream.java:65)

> 1. We need to adjust Dfsck to the new per-file replication feature.
> fsck checks block replication based on the configured global replication parameter.
> Which is now just the default. The actual file replication is returned in DFSFileInfo.
> So at least the reporting is screwed by that, although I didn't check what will happen with
> other options -move and -delete.
> 2. fsck throws NullPointerException if you type
> bin/hadoop fsck -files /doc
> instead of
> bin/hadoop fsck /doc -files
> 3. Unfortunately, there are several commands that throw different kinds of Exceptions
> rather than at least printing the usage info, when some of its arguments are missing or
> misplaced. ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is one them. Try
> bin/hadoop dfs -mv
> bin/hadoop dfs -cp
> bin/hadoop dfs -rm
> 4. In general the shell is growing and getting more sophisticated.
> Should we work out a general convention on how the parameters should be structured, named,
> short/long version of the keywords, help, etc.

> HADOOP-392 introduced a new TreeMap member (datanodeMapByName) in the name node.
> It is used solely for reporting the data nodes in the UI sorted by their names.
> I think it is quite inefficient both time and space-wise to support an excessive
> data structure just for that.
> Suppose the UI will also require sorting by last heartbeat and/or by the available space....
> I think DFSNodesStatus() should just sort the original datanodeMap before returning the list.

I mistakenly submitted the same patch file that I submitted the first time. Sorry. Thanks to Konstantin for pointing it out. I have now placed the patch with just the DatanodeDescriptor -> DatanodeInfo changes. This will apply cleanly to the current trunk.

> DFSNodesStatus() should sort data nodes.

> HADOOP-392 introduced a new TreeMap member (datanodeMapByName) in the name node.
> It is used solely for reporting the data nodes in the UI sorted by their names.
> I think it is quite inefficient both time and space-wise to support an excessive
> data structure just for that.
> Suppose the UI will also require sorting by last heartbeat and/or by the available space....
> I think DFSNodesStatus() should just sort the original datanodeMap before returning the list.

Arun C Murthy commented on HADOOP-54:
-------------------------------------

An implementation detail which I would like to bring to everyone's attention: 

With the 'raw' values now being a concrete object (implementing the 'ValueBytes' interface) we now have a situation in the 'base' sort of SequenceFile.Sorter where we will potentially have to store millions of 'rawValue' objects (assuming a decent sized SequenceFile with 'small' records). 

As it exists today the 'sort' implementation in SequenceFile.Sorter uses 'io.sort.mb' no. of bytes to 'segment' input for sorting (and later merges them). 

Owen suggested we also use 'no. of records' to augment the above in order to prevent situations where we might have to store millions of 'ValueBytes' objects in memory... thus we have a limit on the no. of records (i.e. ValueBytes objects) we use along with 'io.sort.mb' to segment input for sorting.

Thoughts?

> SequenceFile will optionally compress individual values.  But both compression and performance would be much better if sequences of keys and values are compressed together.  Sync marks should only be placed between blocks.  This will require some changes to MapFile too, so that all file positions stored there are the positions of blocks, not entries within blocks.  Probably this can be accomplished by adding a getBlockStartPosition() method to SequenceFile.Writer.

> A benchmark that runs many small MapReduce tasks in sequence. A single map reduce implementation is used, it is invoked multiple times with input as the output from previous run. The input to first Map is a TextInputFormat ( a text file with few hundred KBs). Input records are passed to output without much processing. The idea is to benchmark the time taken by initialization of Mapper and Reducer. An initial prototyping on a single machine with 20 MR tasks in sequence took ~47 seconds per task. Looking for suggestions on what else can be included in the benchmark.

Sanjay Dahiya updated HADOOP-307:
---------------------------------

    Attachment: patch.txt

Patch for classpath issues. The benchmark can now be run using hadoop script without having to set any extra classpath - $HADOOP_HOME/bin/hadoop jar <path to MRBenchmark.jar> smallJobsBenchmark <options .. >. See Readme.txt for an example of options. 
bin/run.sh script can be used as an optional helper script if benchmark needs to be run multiple times with different input configurations. 

thanks Uros for pointing this out.

Sanjay Dahiya commented on HADOOP-239:
--------------------------------------

How about providing an additional JSP for job history. Current JSP's are using live data (not persistant), they will be significantly changed if we read from log file as well as live jobtracker in them. It will be cleaner if we dump the job log in a file and read the file in a separate JSP, linked from current page. Comments ?

Owen O'Malley updated HADOOP-263:
---------------------------------

    Status: Open  (was: Patch Available)

A couple of points need work:
  1. It only catches the finish time of the task.
  2. It includes a couple of comment/whitespace changes that are accidental.
  3. It calls the added field "timestamp", which doesn't say what the time represents.

I was expecting to see:
  2 new fields in TaskStatus:
     private long timeStarted;
     private long timeStopped;
  a new class derived from TaskStatus named ReduceTaskStatus that includes:
     private long timeShuffleFinished;
     private long timeSortFinished;

This patch does point out the high simularity of the TaskStatus and TaskReport. They are basically the same type just slightly filtered by which protocol they are being used on. Why don't you add timeStarted and timeStopped to TaskReport and we can  drop TaskReport in a later patch.

eric baldeschwieler commented on HADOOP-239:
--------------------------------------------

+1 to the general idea of logging the data and reporting from the log.

It would be good to expand a bit on your idea, so it is clear what you are suggesting.

Yoram Arnon updated HADOOP-239:
-------------------------------

    Description: 
The jobtracker's WI, keeps track of jobs executed in the past 24 hours.
if the cluster was idle for a day (say Sunday) it drops all its history.
Monday morning, the page is empty.
Better would be to store a fixed number of jobs (say 10 each of succeeded and failed jobs).

Also, if the job tracker is restarted, it loses all its history.
The history should be persistent, withstanding restarts and upgrades.

> It should be possible to cause a job's log output to be stored in dfs.  The jobtracker's log output and (optionally) all tasktracker log output related to a job should be storable in a job-specified dfs directory.

Devaraj Das updated HADOOP-312:
-------------------------------

               Status: Patch Available  (was: Open)
    Affects Version/s:     (was: 0.4.0)

This patch implements the following:
1) Caching of client - server connections is made optional. Defaults to no-caching.
2) If no-caching is true, clients will disconnect idle connections to a server after a configured time. The idle time defaults to 1 second.

The performance hit in this case is that once in a while clients are not able to establish a connection to a server (if the server is too busy to accept incoming connections). I have seen this in the case of TaskTracker -> JobTracker protocol. It happens once in a while. When it happens, the JobTracker assumes that the TaskTracker is lost and then there is a whole set of reruns for the tasks that were running on this "lost" tasktracker. This slows down the overall progress of the job. Of course, this also happens in the case where the connections are cached but the difference is that the RPCs timeout as opposed to connect failing.

If the above doesn't happen, the performance figures with/without caching on a 370 node cluster is nearly the same.

> Servers and clients (client include datanodes, tasktrackers, DFSClients & tasks) should not cache connections or maybe cache them for very short periods of time. Clients should set up & tear down connections to the servers everytime they need to contact the servers (including the heartbeats). If connection is cached, then reuse the existing connection for a few subsequent transactions until the connection expires. The heartbeat interval should be more so that many more clients (order of  tens of thousands) can be accomodated within 1 heartbeat interval.

DatanodeInfo class should be used instead of DatanodeDescriptor in the jsp & related files
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                 Key: HADOOP-427
                 URL: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-427
             Project: Hadoop
          Issue Type: Bug
          Components: dfs
            Reporter: Devaraj Das
         Assigned To: Devaraj Das
             Fix For: 0.5.1


DatanodeDescriptor should be replaced by DatanodeInfo since DatanodeInfo is a public class and meant to be used by others. Specifically, DatanodeDescriptor is referenced in dfshealth.jsp & JspHelper.java files. Change those references to DatanodeInfo.

Devaraj Das updated HADOOP-427:
-------------------------------

    Attachment: refactor_datanodeinfo.patch

I had submitted this same patch earlier. That was for Hadoop-415 but since that was closed before I submitted the patch I am resubmitting it again.

Sanjay Dahiya commented on HADOOP-239:
--------------------------------------

I meant on JobTracker we log the job transition states in a structured ( XML?) persistent file. This is different from the standard log file and can be parsed and displayed by a JSP page (something like JobHistory.jsp) . It includes only completed and failed jobs. So from the user interface perspective running jobs are displayed as they are currently but failed and completed jobs are displayed from this log.

We can add extra information in this log than what we have currently as a postmortem analysis like time spent by different phases or by different hosts (?). 

This will require unique job ids across jobtracker restarts otherwise it will be difficult to track jobs in history with same id. 
This log file can contain a configurable numbers of days of history, which can be browsed by time. Optionally this history can itself reside in HDFS. Does this make sense ?

> The jobtracker's WI, keeps track of jobs executed in the past 24 hours.
> if the cluster was idle for a day (say Sunday) it drops all its history.
> Monday morning, the page is empty.
> Better would be to store a fixed number of jobs (say 10 each of succeeded and failed jobs).
> Also, if the job tracker is restarted, it loses all its history.
> The history should be persistent, withstanding restarts and upgrades.

Milind Bhandarkar commented on HADOOP-64:
-----------------------------------------

I have profiled the namenode, and most action in namenode happens as a response to heartbeat and blockreport messages. Therefore I think it is important to enable the datanode to handle multiple volumes. this also relates to hadoop-50, which needs handling multiple directories. The scheme I have in mind is for datanode to load-balance among volumes (that corrspond to multiple disks) and then within a volume, block-placement will be done within multiple directories according to block-id. I am currently preparing a proposal on this issue.

> The dfs Datanode can only store data on a single filesystem volume. When a node runs its disks JBOD this means running a Datanode per disk on the machine. While the scheme works reasonably well on small clusters, on larger installations (several 100 nodes) it implies a very large number of Datanodes with associated management overhead in the Namenode.
> The Datanod should be enhanced to be able to handle multiple volumes on a single machine.

Yoram Arnon commented on HADOOP-239:
------------------------------------

if a job tracker fails while running a job, you'd want the failed job's information shown in the history, so you probably want to log a job in the file as soon as it's launched, rather than when it's completed.

There are several links that can be drilled down into from the job information - tasks, failed tasks, task trackers etc. Take care to store all that information in the log file so we do not lose any current functionality.

creating a file per day may be good, as it will enable a simple way of keeping a configurable length of history.

Yoram Arnon commented on HADOOP-312:
------------------------------------

lost tasktrackers because the jobtracker is temporarily busy is a bad thing.
we should have some sort of retry mechanism, or a longer accept queue on the server, or some allowable number of lost heartbeats, or something - to overcome this.
As a rule, barring hardware failure and user-code bugs, any time a tasktracker is lost is a bug.

> Servers and clients (client include datanodes, tasktrackers, DFSClients & tasks) should not cache connections or maybe cache them for very short periods of time. Clients should set up & tear down connections to the servers everytime they need to contact the servers (including the heartbeats). If connection is cached, then reuse the existing connection for a few subsequent transactions until the connection expires. The heartbeat interval should be more so that many more clients (order of  tens of thousands) can be accomodated within 1 heartbeat interval.

Sanjay Dahiya commented on HADOOP-239:
--------------------------------------

I agree, but to display the status of running job we can use the existing infrastructure rather than the log file as it already provides the most current status. We will log as things happen but use it for display when job fails/completes or job tracker restarts. 
Yes, the current functionality should be the minimum thats available in the log.

Devaraj Das commented on HADOOP-312:
------------------------------------

I agree with this. In the current code, there is a timeout of 10 minutes and only when a TaskTracker is out of contact for this much amount of time does the JobTracker assume that the TaskTracker is dead. Unfortunately, even with this large timeout, sometimes an unfortunate TaskTracker cannot make it. Yes, the accept queue can be made longer but we will hit the problem sometime later when we have more clients. So,  do you think, in addition to increasing the accept queue size, it makes sense to have a two-way heartbeat here? That is, if a server doesn't receive a heartbeat from a client and the expiry-timeout is about to expire, it schedules a heartbeat to the client and probably invokes a GETSTATUS or some such method on the client and if that method returns a valid response, it keeps the client alive for another expiry-timeout interval and this goes on... We can also look at other approaches - some of them are outlined in hadoop-362.
By the way, the patch for hadoop-181 should handle the lost tracker problem but this kind of a problem might turn up for any client-server interaction.

Condor and Hadoop Map Reduce integration
----------------------------------------

                 Key: HADOOP-428
                 URL: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-428
             Project: Hadoop
          Issue Type: New Feature
          Components: mapred
            Reporter: Devaraj Das
         Assigned To: Devaraj Das


The issue is about using/enhancing Condor's features for Hadoop's Map Reduce framework. Some of the early thoughts in this respect:
* One should be able to submit a MR job that takes advantage of Condor's features like node reservation according to a job's requirements, monitoring of jobs, etc.
* JobTracker and TaskTrackers work as Master/Workers in the Condor environment. One should be able to simply start a MR cluster and the cluster goes down when the job is done.
* The classads can have an attribute for input file block locations that will be an input to Condor's scheduling decisions.
* Condor's features of monitoring jobs can be leveraged to reschedule failed TaskTrackers. Checkpointing of JobTrackers can also probably be done so that if the JobTracker job dies for some reason, the failed jobs can be restarted to start from the point where the JobTracker was last checkpointed at (assuming the input data has not changed).
* User priorities, job priorities should also be handled. If nodes are currently in use due to a job being run by one user, and another user of the same priority submits a new job, it gets queued and opportunistically the job of the second user is scheduled - for e.g., one master and 1 worker to start with and then 2 workers and so on... If the second user is of a higher priority, then the first user's job is completely suspended.
Please add your thoughts on this topic.

eric baldeschwieler commented on HADOOP-239:
--------------------------------------------

+1 to the gist of this (Sanjay's latest suggestions and yoram's point about startup).

Putting the log in HDFS is interesting, but perhaps a distraction short term.

I think it would be worth trying to use the actual log infrastructure to store this information.  Rolling, compression, removal after a fixed time, no lost state when the sever fails...  all of this sounds like logging.

Milind Bhandarkar commented on HADOOP-64:
-----------------------------------------

Proposal:

In the configuration (e.g. hadoop-site.xml), site-admin can specify a comma separated list of volumes as a value corresponding to key "dfs.data.dir". These volumes are assumed to be mounted on different disks. Thus the total disk capacity for the datanode is assumed to be a sum of disk capacities of these volumes, in addition, taking into account the /dev/sda* or /dev/hda* mapping of these volumes (i.e. not counting the same /dev/* twice.)

New blocks are created round-robin in these volumes. The policy for block-allocation is controlled by a separable piece of code, so that different policies can be substituted at runtime later. Mapping of datablocks to volume-id is kept in memory of datanode. When the datanode comes up again, it discovers this mapping by reading specified volumes. Later, when datanode is also periodically checkpointed, this mapping is stored in the checkpoint as well.

Each volume is further automatically split into multiple subdirectories (the number of these directories is configurable, and should be a power of 2, so that the last x bits of a block-id is used to determine which subdirectory the block is stored in. this is the scheme used in Mike's patch for hadoop-50.

If a datanode is re-configured with different number (or locations) of volumes for dfs.data.dir, the blocks stored in earlier locations are considered by the datanode to be lost (when in future, the datanode is checkpointed, it will try to recover those "lost" blocks). If one of the volumes is read-only, it will currently be considered to be dead only with-respect-to that volume. i.e. it will still continue to store blocks in read-write volumes, but blocks in the read-only volumes will be considered lost, since they cannot be deleted.)

Please comment on this proposal asap, so that I can go ahead with implementation.

Bryan Pendleton commented on HADOOP-64:
---------------------------------------

Why do datanodes need to checkpoint? What's the value of storing out the mapping, vs. re-enumerating them at startup time? The namenode doesn't keep track of what nodes have which blocks, why should a storage node keep track any more rigorously within its own state? I'd argue that all of that complexity is needless - the cost of maintaining a consistent state is way too high for little benefit.

Please make it very easy to change the block-allocation code. The default behaviors of the current code have been causing troubles on my very heterogenous cluster for a very long time - uniform distribution only really actually makes sense if the same amount of space is available on each drive. For all other cases, doing this leads immediately to unnecessary failures.

I'm not sure about the "blocks considered lost on read-only volumes" bit, but, if that implies that the blocks become unavailable, then I think the approach is too heavy-handed. Those blocks might be the only copies, and ignoring them means that cluster might not be able to find a live copy of a block anywhere else. Please clarify what a "lost" block is.

             Project: Hadoop
          Issue Type: Improvement
            Reporter: Bryan Pendleton


Continuance of Hadoop-386. The patch to that issue makes it possible to redistribute blocks (change replication up, wait for replication to succeed, then lower replication again). However, this requires a lot more space, is not automatic, and doesn't respect a reasonable I/O limit. I have actually had MapReduce jobs fail from block missing execptions after having recently changed the replication level (from 3 to 4, with no underreplications to start with) because the datanodes were too slow responding to requests while performing the necessary replications.

A good fix to this problem would be a low-priority thread on the NameNode that schedules low-priority replications of blocks on over-full machines, followed by the removal of the extra replications. It might be worth having a specific prototocol for asking for these low-priority copies to happen in the datanodes, so that they continue to service (and be available to service) normal block requests.

Sameer Paranjpye commented on HADOOP-64:
----------------------------------------

Can we map effectively map volumes to devices on Windows? Will 'df' under cygwin produce a comprehensible mapping of paths to devices? Maybe this should be left out of the implementation?

Code for monitoring disk capacity on the datanode will need to be updated to run 'df' on all volumes considered.  Round robin placement needs to account for differences in capacity on the various volumes.

How does this interact with Konstantin's storage id implementation? We will now need to have 1 storage-id across multiple volumes.

Do we need to use the last x-bits of a block to map it to a directory? Maybe we should use a simple round robin scheme here as well. The amount of state is small enough to keep in a hastable, no?

Do we ever need to checkpoint datanodes? Seems like that is a separable discussion. In any case, it seems like the less state we keep in side files the better it is.

We should include a mechanism to make read-only volumes visible on the namenode, as part of the health/status page, so that admins can be alerted in a timely manner.

          Components: dfs
    Affects Versions: 0.5.0
            Reporter: Konstantin Shvachko
             Fix For: 0.5.1
         Attachments: RegistrationOrder.patch

HADOOP-375 changed the order in which a data node registers and starts its http server.
Current version first starts the http server, then registers. As a result if the registration fails,
which can happen e.g. if the datanode has illegal storage id (=does not belong to the cluster),
the http server keeps running, which makes the data node seem running too.
I think 2 things need to be done.
1) Datanode registration should precede the http server startup.
2) The http server should shutdown when the datanode fails (in general).
I am attaching a patch for the first item.
Does anybody know how the latter can be done in the version of jetty we are on now?

Milind Bhandarkar commented on HADOOP-64:
-----------------------------------------

About check-pointing datanodes. I agree that it is a needless complexity. I was confused about this as well. But as Konstantin pointed out to me, the datanode checkpointing proposal is NOT checkpointing datanodes' state, but checkpointing datanodes' blockreport in the namenode checkpoint. Thanks konstantin.

As the proposal (and the implementation) currently stands, if dfs.data.dir is read-only, the datanode reports to be dead, since block-delete etc operations cannot be carried out on it. The namenode treats that datanode as dead, and tries to re-replicate its blocks on other data nodes. The same behavior will continue, except the datanode will not report itself to be dead if at least one volume specified in the dfs.data.dir list is read-write. However, it will not report blocks contained in read-only volumes.

Storage-ID continues to be one per datanode. Putting blocks in different volumes is datanode-internal.

The DF.java contains code to detect mount. This will be considered to be the differentiation between different disks. Even if it is not right, it does not preclude correct operation of datanode, only performance is affected. Performance will be maximized if all volumes specified in dfs.data.dir are located on different local disks.

Making read-only mounts visible on namenode is an orthogonal issue. My proposal specifies a backward-compatible way of dealing with it.

Using the last x bits to map a block on local directory will minimize datanode's state as well as keep the directory size minimal (since block-ids are random). Consider it an implicit hashtable on disk.

> The dfs Datanode can only store data on a single filesystem volume. When a node runs its disks JBOD this means running a Datanode per disk on the machine. While the scheme works reasonably well on small clusters, on larger installations (several 100 nodes) it implies a very large number of Datanodes with associated management overhead in the Namenode.
> The Datanod should be enhanced to be able to handle multiple volumes on a single machine.

Yoram Arnon commented on HADOOP-64:
-----------------------------------

dfs.data.dir is currently used to specify the location of temporary files written by dfs client (data is written to disk, then an entire dfs block is streamed to the datanodes). Rather than trying to support a multiple-volume behaviour there too, let's separate the client config from the datanode config, using 'client.tempdata.dir'. Try to make the change backwards compatible.

read-only drives are hard to maintain except by totally ignoring them, since data can not be deleted from them. If a file is deleted, then a blockid is reclaimed for another file, bad things might happen if that blockid is served by some read-only volume. If it's the last copy of a block, *and* the volume is read-only and on its way to be dead, then that block is unfortunately lost.

round robin is a bit harsh as an allocation scheme. allocation proportional to free space would work better IMO.

thats for looking at job parameters - input/output etc on the web page itself if we keeps lots of jobs in history. currently we have it as a path in a temp directory displayed on the JSP. We can have the same path there or dump the jobConf in the log file.

Bryan Pendleton commented on HADOOP-64:
---------------------------------------

It sounds like its a different issue, but, I'm still worried about the "treat read-only as dead" option.

I regularly see old drives throw out enough IDE errors to get remounted read-only. Often times, a reboot will bring the drive back online just fine - and bring back the blocks that weren't deleted from it. If that block number was reused in the meantime, we'll have a problem anyway, regardless of whether we treat that block as readable once the initial read-only condition is encountered. Meanwhile, we've possibly missed an opportunity to save a block from early death, since a copy of it is still actually available.

I'll probably open up another issue around this later one, once the current one is closed, just to clarify. In the meantime, is there a realistic issue with block numbers being reused, such that an old block coming online would pervert things? Should a datanode maybe be periodically requesting the CRCs for its blocks, and checking to see if they still match? This generally falls into the space of "a good idea" anyway, since, barring reading a block, there's no way to tell if its disk has gone bad.

Yoram Arnon commented on HADOOP-312:
------------------------------------

the current model, where a tasktracker sends a heartbeat every few seconds, and is declared dead only after 10 minutes is fine, as long as the rate of loss of heartbeats is low.
I'm only concerned, since the size of the accept queue is fairly small by default (~5), that  the probability of missing a new connection will be significantly greater than the probability of losing a message in an open tcp stream (very low). Increasing the size of the queue, or implemeting some form of retries could help.

There's a tradeoff here between the overhead of many 'accept's per second and the overhead of 'select'ing on many sockets, many of which are idle. Let's compare performance with and without connection caching, and see where we get more lost heartbeats, and better jobtracker performance.

> Servers and clients (client include datanodes, tasktrackers, DFSClients & tasks) should not cache connections or maybe cache them for very short periods of time. Clients should set up & tear down connections to the servers everytime they need to contact the servers (including the heartbeats). If connection is cached, then reuse the existing connection for a few subsequent transactions until the connection expires. The heartbeat interval should be more so that many more clients (order of  tens of thousands) can be accomodated within 1 heartbeat interval.

Konstantin Shvachko commented on HADOOP-64:
-------------------------------------------

 = I believe there was a misunderstanding on the datanode checkpointing issue.
HADOOP-306 proposes to checkpoint only the list of datanodes, effectively DatanodeInfo.
It was not meant to store the datanode block reports.
The block map is not and should not be checkpointed.

= DF on Windows will return the drive letter, which can be used to distinguish disks.
It will work only for local disks though. Mounted (mapped network) drives on Windows won't work.

= I agree storageID should be the same per node. It will need to be stored separately on each drive.
Otherwise, if only one drive stores the id and gets corrupted we will not be able to restore the
storage id for other drives. Also, the storage files on each drive should be locked when the datanode
starts to prevent from running multiple data nodes with the same blocks.

= It is a good idea that the number of directories is a power of 2.
But I do not support the idea to reserve any number of bits of block-id to determine block locations, for 2 reasons.
a) Block replicas can have different locations on different data nodes.
b) The block id is issued by the namenode, and it is not good if the namenode will need to
know about a datanode storage setup.
Instead, we can partition bit representation of the block id into a number of parts consistent
with the number of directories and e.g. XOR them. The result will represent the directory name.
I think this will be random enough.

= I don't think the datanode can be even start on a read-only disk.
The storage file won't open.

Arun C Murthy updated HADOOP-54:
--------------------------------

    Attachment: SequenceFiles.patch

Here's the patch for block compressed SequenceFiles.

Main attractions:
a) Three different writers for SequenceFiles: Writer, RecordCompressWriter, BlockCompressWriter (with a factory to create the different writers).
b) The 'raw' apis are significantly different (as per previous discussions here)
c) Fixed SequenceFile.Sorter to take advantage of new 'raw' apis and some minor tweak/enhancements there.

As per Owen's suggestion, I've only uploaded the patch... once I get some feedback, I'll go ahead and change the 'status' to 'Patch Available'.

> SequenceFile will optionally compress individual values.  But both compression and performance would be much better if sequences of keys and values are compressed together.  Sync marks should only be placed between blocks.  This will require some changes to MapFile too, so that all file positions stored there are the positions of blocks, not entries within blocks.  Probably this can be accomplished by adding a getBlockStartPosition() method to SequenceFile.Writer.

Barry (and everyone else),

It's definitely not too late to RSVP for the Nutch/Hadoop meetup.

Remember, it's August 9, in Seattle, WA at 7pm.

BigTime Brewery
4133 University Way NE, Seattle, WA

BigTime is just about a ten minute walk from the main SIGIR venue.

when using hadoop dfs -rm <path> the behaviour is like that of rm -rf.
That's very dangerous.
A better behaviour would require a confirmation and allow removal of files only by default. Optional flags would allow recursive and forced deleted.

currently, once you delete a file it's gone forever.
most file systems allow some form of recovery of deleted files.
a simple solution would be an 'undelete' command.
a more comprehensive solution would include snapshots, manual and automatic, with scheduling options.

            Reporter: Benjamin Reed
            Priority: Minor


The record reader has access to the FileSplit which can in turn have information that is useful to the Mapper. For example, Map processing may vary according to file name or attributes associated with a file. Unfortunately, even using a MapRunner you only have access to the progress wrapper of the RecordReader. To get access to the real record reader I had to use a thread local variable which I set in RecordReader.getNext(). It would be much nicer if you could get a reference to the real RecordReader from the RecordReader passed to MapRunner.

Hadoop 0.5 automagically fixes this.

> Not knowing how to reclassify an existing bug, I am opening this new bug under Hadoop.
> The version number is 0.3.3 but because I don't see it in the jira list, I chose the closest matching version.  The Nutch-with-GUI build was running with hadoop-0.2 but stopped running, exhibiting the same symptom with other nightly builds, when switched to use hadoop-0.3.3.
> I checked "fs" as component but this bug could also be caused by the order in which jobs are scheduled, I suspect.

> A benchmark that runs many small MapReduce tasks in sequence. A single map reduce implementation is used, it is invoked multiple times with input as the output from previous run. The input to first Map is a TextInputFormat ( a text file with few hundred KBs). Input records are passed to output without much processing. The idea is to benchmark the time taken by initialization of Mapper and Reducer. An initial prototyping on a single machine with 20 MR tasks in sequence took ~47 seconds per task. Looking for suggestions on what else can be included in the benchmark.

------------------------------------


we encounter this need all the time, and are always blocked by that progress wrapper.

another way might be to just inject the split information into the jobconf when the split is opened by the maptask.

> The record reader has access to the FileSplit which can in turn have information that is useful to the Mapper. For example, Map processing may vary according to file name or attributes associated with a file. Unfortunately, even using a MapRunner you only have access to the progress wrapper of the RecordReader. To get access to the real record reader I had to use a thread local variable which I set in RecordReader.getNext(). It would be much nicer if you could get a reference to the real RecordReader from the RecordReader passed to MapRunner.

          Components: contrib/streaming
            Reporter: Sanjay Dahiya
         Assigned To: Sanjay Dahiya


Small job benchmark uses its own scripts to set classpath, it should use hadoop scripts with ProgramDriver to run the benchmark.

> the current behaviour, whereby a file is not visible until it is closed has several flaws,including:
> 1. no practical way to know if a file/job is progressing
> 2. no way to implement files that never close, such as log files
> 3. failure to close a file results in loss of the file
> The part of the file that's written should be visible.

> DatanodeDescriptor should be replaced by DatanodeInfo since DatanodeInfo is a public class and meant to be used by others. Specifically, DatanodeDescriptor is referenced in dfshealth.jsp & JspHelper.java files. Change those references to DatanodeInfo.

> the current behaviour, whereby a file is not visible until it is closed has several flaws,including:
> 1. no practical way to know if a file/job is progressing
> 2. no way to implement files that never close, such as log files
> 3. failure to close a file results in loss of the file
> The part of the file that's written should be visible.

-------------------------------------

It strikes me that we should instead improve detection of task tracker death, rather than to try to revive things when we mistakenly decide one is dead.  Thoughts?

Owen O'Malley commented on HADOOP-431:
--------------------------------------

-1 on making -i the default. (*smile* "-1" even looks like "-i")

Part of the problem with even making the unix default the default is that in Hadoop, every logical file is modelled as a directory with a bunch of files in it (eg. my-data/part-* ). I'd suggest that the default should be willing to delete a first-level directory, but not a second-level or higher directory. (I'm defining a first-level directory to mean a directory with no sub-directories.)

Owen O'Malley commented on HADOOP-433:
--------------------------------------

This is largely addressed by the extensions I put into the JobConf task localization code. Look at MapTask.localizeConfiguration.

In particular, each Mapper has available to it:
map.input.file
map.input.start
map.input.length

For application writers that don't want to read the Hadoop code, I've put the list of attributes in:
http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-hadoop/TaskExecutionEnvironment

This will let you get an equivalent RecordReader even if it is not the same object. Will that address your problem?

> The record reader has access to the FileSplit which can in turn have information that is useful to the Mapper. For example, Map processing may vary according to file name or attributes associated with a file. Unfortunately, even using a MapRunner you only have access to the progress wrapper of the RecordReader. To get access to the real record reader I had to use a thread local variable which I set in RecordReader.getNext(). It would be much nicer if you could get a reference to the real RecordReader from the RecordReader passed to MapRunner.

Milind Bhandarkar commented on HADOOP-64:
-----------------------------------------

Thanks for your inputs Yoram, Konstantin, Bryan, Sameer.

Here is my modified proposal:

1. The config parameter dfs.data.dir could have a list of directories separated by commas.
2. Another config parameter (client.buffer.dir) will contain comma-separated list of directories for buffering blocks until they are sent to datanode. DFS client will manage the in-memory map of blocks to these directories.
3. Datanode will maintain a map in memory of blockid's mapped to storage locations.
4. Datanode will choose appropriate location to write a block based on a separate block-to-volume placement strategy. Information about volumes will be made available to this strategy with DF.
5. Datanode will try to report correct available diskspace by appropriately taking into account the space reported by DF on each volume. If the mount point is same for more than one volume, then the available disk space will not be counted twice.
6. Storage-ID will be unique per data node, and will be stored in each of the volumes at top levels.
7. Each volume will further be separated into a shallow directory hierarchy, with maximum of N blocks per directory. This block to directory mapping will also be maintained in a hashtable by datanode. as a directory fills up, new directory will be created as a sibling, upto a maximum of N siblings. Then second level of directories will start. The parameter N can be specified as a config variable "dfs.data.numdir".
8. Only if all the volumes specified in dfs.data.dir are read-only, the datanode will shutdown. Otherwise, it will log the readonly directories, and treat them as if they were never specified in dfs.data.dir list. This behavior is consistent with current state of implementation.

If there are any other issues to think about, please comment.

While the scheme works reasonably well on small clusters, on larger installations (several 100 nodes) it implies a very large number of Datanodes with associated management overhead in the Namenode.

Wendy Chien updated HADOOP-324:
-------------------------------

    Attachment: hadoop-324.patch

This patch fixes the problem by checking the message of the IOException to see if it is "No space left on device".   If so, then it throws a new DiskOutOfSpaceException and does not shutdown.  If not, then it does what it originally did, shutdown.  

If there are objections to this way, please let me know.

Yoram Arnon commented on HADOOP-64:
-----------------------------------

We could consider the datanode doing some kind of best effort if one volume is read-only, by copying that volume's data locally to the other volumes before shutting down the bad volume. Best effort only - if there isn't enough space for everything then just copy what you can and move on. It may decrease the number of blocks that need to be replicated over the network.

Devaraj Das commented on HADOOP-181:
------------------------------------

I am open to a discussion on this but I thought that while we are discussing the possible solutions to the TaskTracker heartbeat problem in Hadoop-312 (I am actually testing a patch with increased queue length + retries), I think we can consider this patch as a solution to the problem raised in this Jira issue. Doesn't harm I think.

> TaskTrackers should not close and restart themselves for having a late heartbeat. The JobTracker should just accept their current status.

> The job tracker tries not to run tasks that have previously failed on a node on that node again, but it doesn't strictly prevent it.
> I propose to change the rule so that when pollForNewTask is called by a TaskTracker, the JobTracker will only assign it a task that has failed on that TaskTracker, if and only if it has already failed on the entire cluster. Thus, for "normal" clusters with more than 4 TaskTrackers, you will be guaranteed that it will run on 4 different TaskTrackers. For small clusters, it will run on every TaskTracker in the cluster at least once.
> Does that sound reasonable to everyone?

Benjamin Reed commented on HADOOP-433:
--------------------------------------

If I understand correctly, you are suggesting that I instantiate another RecordReader using the information in JobConf. If I do that, progress will not be updated correctly unless I also do that myself. At that point it is easier to just do the ThreadLocal variable hack I currently use to get the real RecordReader. In both cases you are looking at just a few lines of code, but it is ugly-silly-slightly-confusing code.

> The record reader has access to the FileSplit which can in turn have information that is useful to the Mapper. For example, Map processing may vary according to file name or attributes associated with a file. Unfortunately, even using a MapRunner you only have access to the progress wrapper of the RecordReader. To get access to the real record reader I had to use a thread local variable which I set in RecordReader.getNext(). It would be much nicer if you could get a reference to the real RecordReader from the RecordReader passed to MapRunner.

---------------------------------

    Attachment: patch.txt

A new patch, now shows start, finish times for tasks and shuffle/sort finished time for reduce tasks. 
few points, which should probably be separate issues. 
- TaskStatus, TeskReport replicate some status data which is present as member variables in TaskTracker.TaskInProgress, TaskInProgress. We can reduce the duplication of data by maintaining objects of TaskStatus and get/set from that directly, using simple composition. 
- The status string passed around needs to be a public static final String defined in TaskStatus and used everywhere else, so it can be compared against reliably wrt future changes. Currently its reduce > copy (...), reduce > sort, reduce > reduce.

Encapsulating startup scripts and jars in a single Jar file.
------------------------------------------------------------

                 Key: HADOOP-435
                 URL: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-435
             Project: Hadoop
          Issue Type: New Feature
    Affects Versions: 0.5.0
            Reporter: Benjamin Reed
         Attachments: hadoopit.patch

Currently, hadoop is a set of scripts, configurations, and jar files. It makes it a pain to install on compute and datanodes. It also makes it a pain to setup clients so that they can use hadoop. Everytime things are updated the pain begins again.

I suggest that we should be able to build a single Jar file that has a Main-Class defined with the configuration built in so that we can distribute that one file to nodes and clients on updates. One nice thing that I haven't done would be to make the jarfile downloadable from the JobTracker webpage so that clients can easily submit the jobs.

I currently use such a setup on my small cluster. To start the job tracker I used "java -jar hadoop.jar -l /tmp/log jobtracker" to submit a job I use "java -jar hadoop.jar jar wordcount.jar". I used the client on my linux and Mac OSX machines and I'll I need installed in java and the hadoop.jar file.

hadoop.jar helps with logfiles and configurations. The default of pulling the config files from the jar file can be overridden by specifying a config directory so that you can easily have machine specific configs and still have the same hadoop.jar on all machines.

Here are the available commands from hadoop.jar:
USAGE: hadoop [-l logdir] command
  User commands:
    dfs          run a DFS admin client
    jar          run a JAR file
    job          manipulate MapReduce jobs
    fsck         run a DFS filesystem check utility
  Runtime startup commands:
    datanode     run a DFS datanode
    jobtracker   run the MapReduce job Tracker node
    namenode     run the DFS namenode (namenode -format formats the FS)
    tasktracker  run a MapReduce task Tracker node
  HadoopLoader commands:
    buildJar     builds the HadoopLoader jar file
    conf         dump hadoop configuration

Note, I don't have the classes for hadoop streaming built into this Jar file, but if I had that would also be an option (it checks for needed classes before displaying an option). It makes it very easy for users that just write scripts to use hadoop straight from their machines.

I'm also attaching the start.sh and stop.sh scripts that I use. These are the only scripts I use to startup the daemons. They are very simple and the start.sh script uses the config file to figure out whether or not to start the jobtracker and the nameserver.

The attached patch adds the HadoopIt patch, modifies the Configuration class to find the config files correctly, and modifies the build to make a fully contained hadoop.jar. To update the configuration in a hadoop.jar you simply use "zip hadoop.jar hadoop-site.xml".

> When a data node disk is almost full the name node still assigns blocks to the data node.
> By the time the data node actually tries to write that data to disk the disk may become full.
> Current implementation forces the data node to shutdown after that.

          Issue Type: Bug
          Components: mapred
            Reporter: Devaraj Das


In the getMapOutput.jsp, tracker.mapOutputLost is called irrespective of whether the sender of the map output threw an exception or the receiver died (thereby closing the socket causing the jsp to throw an exception). Invoking the method causes the corresponding map task to fail and causes it to be rescheduled but it may be the case that the problem is at the reciever's end. Need to do a better check of where the exception was thrown.

Why not provide a pointer to the real record reader?  Seems like a  
valid OO way to get access to all kinds of things.

Konstantin Shvachko commented on HADOOP-64:
-------------------------------------------

This proposition looks good to me.
The only thing that seems excessive is the dynamic data structures for maintaining
blockid-to-directory mapping.
The alternative is to do a static mapping based on blockids and the number of directories.
Suppose that the maximal number of entries per directory is N. We should define a function
      dirName( blockId, N, dirLevel )
which returns a local directory name for each level of the directory tree.
So the datanode needs to store  only the current hight  of the directory tree H.
Then for a given  blockId, its path is determined by
      / dirName(blockId,N,0) / dirName(blockId,N,1) / ... / dirName(blockId,N,H)
And when the datanode needs to add a new directory level it will not need
to rename anything in the existing directory tree.
I see a disadvantage of this approach, that the directories should be
re-structured if the maximal number of entries per directory is changed.
But the same is applicable for the dynamic approach, at least when N is decreased.
We might consider hardcoding N rather than having it configurable.

> The dfs Datanode can only store data on a single filesystem volume. When a node runs its disks JBOD this means running a Datanode per disk on the machine. While the scheme works reasonably well on small clusters, on larger installations (several 100 nodes) it implies a very large number of Datanodes with associated management overhead in the Namenode.
> The Datanod should be enhanced to be able to handle multiple volumes on a single machine.

Sameer Paranjpye commented on HADOOP-181:
-----------------------------------------

I feel that improved detection of tasktracker death is a separate issue, which needs addressing. At the same time, we need to try and not lose work if communication between a tasktracker and the jobtracker fails for some reason.

For instance, a tasktracker may appear lost to the jobtracker due to transient network problems. In such a case it would be ok for the jobtracker to mark the lost tasks as failed and reschedule them to other places. 
If communication to the jobtracker is subsequently restored, while the job is still in progress, the jobtracker can 
easily mark the lost and found tasks as succeeded. Multiple instances of a task should be handled by the speculative execution code. It seems like we could avoid losing a lot of work if we had such as mechanism in place.

Those attributes were put in to the JobConf so that Hadoop could re- 
run an isolated task, so they had to be serializable. Putting real  
objects into the JobConf breaks that property.

Ben hasn't explained why he wants the RecordReader, so I was trying  
to guess. The problem with giving out references to the RecordReader  
is that you are exposing the framework's implementation details. In  
particular, all you can really do to a record reader is advance it.  
That really isn't something that the Mapper should be doing.

just fyi, here are the reasons we tend to encounter:

- regex'd metadata from a filename (for example, date, data source, etc...
anything that exists on a per-file basis and not embedded in every record)
- error message ("illegal widget name", "file XXX"), usually in an output
record which is later reduced
- etc...

each of these are handled just fine by having the filename in the jobconf.

im sure there are other purposes, but these are what we run into.

eric baldeschwieler commented on HADOOP-431:
--------------------------------------------

I'd support a -r command to remove a directory.  A lot of user commands may not be on reduce directories, so I don't think it is true that EVERY logical file is a subdirectory.

That said, I also like the idea of differentiating between removing one directory and removing lots of them.  What about requiring -rr if you really mean to do a deep recursive delete?

-i seems like overkill to me.

Advancing the reader sounds like "a bad idea".

But an exotic reader might have all kinds of context it could  
publish.  maybe current line number, rowID, SQL statement used...   
Who knows.  There could be lots of stuff.

It would be nice to have an interface that lets you get to any  
methods your subclassed reader has decided to publish.

Pushing this through the config doesn't seem right.  Having an  
available method a mapper can invoke does.

DFS pathname limitation.
------------------------

                 Key: HADOOP-438
                 URL: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-438
             Project: Hadoop
          Issue Type: Bug
          Components: dfs
    Affects Versions: 0.5.0, 0.4.0, 0.3.2, 0.3.1, 0.3.0, 0.2.1, 0.2.0, 0.1.1, 0.1.0
            Reporter: Konstantin Shvachko
             Fix For: 0.6.0


I was trying to create a deep hierarchy of directories using DFS mkdirs().
When the path to the leaf directory became long (~20000) DFS was still able to create
directories with these names, but UTF8 started truncating long strings resulting in
incorrect logging of namespace edits. That later crashed the namenode during restart,
when it was trying to reproduce file creation logged in the edits file with truncated names.
UTF8 is deprecated now so we will have to replace it with Text.
With UTF8  we should enforce a pathname limit of 0xffff/3 = 21845
With Text it is going to be larger. Not sure what the exact number is.

The streaming code internally reads the input data into a UTF8 .  This causes truncated data to be shipped to the mapper when the input exceeds about 21000 characters, with no notice to the user except possibly in individual tasks' machines' logs, which people would not normally read for apparently successful jobs.

SequenceFile should support 'custom compressors'

             Fix For: 0.6.0


SequenceFiles should support 'custom compressors' which can be specified by the user on creation of the file. 

Readily available packages for gzip and zip (java.util.zip) are among obvious choices to support. Also 'bmdiff' seems a good candidate for adding support for. Of course there will be hooks so that other compressors can be added in future as long as there is a way to construct (input/output) streams on top of the compressor/decompressor.

The 'classname' of the 'custom compressor/decompressor' could be stored in the header of the SequenceFile which can then be used by SequenceFile.Reader to figure out the appropriate 'decompressor'. Thus I propose we add constructors to SequenceFile.Writer which take in the 'classname' of the compressor's input/output stream classes (e.g. DeflaterOutputStream/InflaterInputStream or GZIPOutputStream/GZIPInputStream), which acts as the hook for future compressors/decompressors.

Looks like there isn't a java library for bmdiff (I'd love to be corrected on this)... thoughts on how to go about this? A JNI wrapper on top of a C api? If so how difficult does hadoop-dev think it is to implement a input/output stream on top of this? Alternatives?

Doug Cutting commented on HADOOP-181:
-------------------------------------

> improved detection of tasktracker death is a separate issue

It's certainly related.  This issue deals with fixing things when tasktracker deaths are mis-detected.  If we didn't misdetect so much, this would not be an issue.

> Multiple instances of a task should be handled by the speculative execution code.

What if speculative execution is disabled in the job?  Then we'd get multiple instances of the task running at once, when the client explicitly requested that not happen.

I'm +0 on this patch.  If others feel strongly that it's the best approach, I won't veto it.  But I would prefer we address the root problem first, and then see if this is still an issue, before adding this new mechanism.  Does that make sense, or am I missing something?

Yoram Arnon commented on HADOOP-181:
------------------------------------

Eric, we don't get many lost task trackers in our sort benchmark any more, so I don't expect a significant improvement.

In other jobs though, we do get the occasional lost task tracker. While every such case is a bug when nothing 'real' happens (HW error, network etc.) hunting every last one of them down is going to take quite a while.
Minimizing the damage caused by such a glitch would be welcome if it doesn't cause adverse side effects.

> TaskTrackers should not close and restart themselves for having a late heartbeat. The JobTracker should just accept their current status.

                 URL: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-442
             Project: Hadoop
          Issue Type: Bug
            Reporter: Yoram Arnon


I recently had a few nodes go bad, such that they were inaccessible to ssh, but were still running their java processes.
tasks that executed on them were failing, causing jobs to fail.
I couldn't stop the java processes, because of the ssh issue, so I was helpless until I could actually power down these nodes.
restarting the cluster doesn't help, even when removing the bad nodes from the slaves file - they just reconnect and are accepted.
while we plan to avoid tasks from launching on the same nodes over and over, what I'd like is to be able to prevent rogue processes from connecting to the masters.
Ideally, the slaves file will contain an 'exclude' section, which will list nodes that shouldn't be accessed, and should be ignored if they try to connect. That would also help in configuring the slaves file for a large cluster - I'd list the full range of machines in the cluster, then list the ones that are down in the 'exclude' section

          Issue Type: Improvement
            Reporter: Yoram Arnon


if the namenode state (fsimage, edits) contains a bad entry, the namenode refused to start.
Normally that's a good thing, alerting the administrator that something's corrupted.
An option to ignore those entries is useful for recovering from such a condition. Anyone but a hard core developer would be helpless in the face of a corruption like that, and would prefer to lose a couple of records and be able to run than to be down, or remove the entire state of dfs.

          Issue Type: Bug
          Components: contrib/streaming
    Affects Versions: 0.5.0
            Reporter: Dick King


When the dust settled after a streaming run, the directory ended up looking like this:

  /user/dking/<project-name>/K-HTML-UTF8-2006-08-09-rescued-abstracted/task_0026_m_007384_0	<r 3>	10563406

Future processing will receive duplicated data.

Bryan Pendleton commented on HADOOP-442:
----------------------------------------

I too have had problems like this over time.

Another way to deal with this might be to hand out a new random ID to each instance on startup. The namenode/jobtracker would know the "correct" value, and treat as rogue any nodes which try to register but don't know the current "correct" value. This could be re-set at each full-cluster restart, to make sure that all nodes participating are "up to date" and correct.

> I recently had a few nodes go bad, such that they were inaccessible to ssh, but were still running their java processes.
> tasks that executed on them were failing, causing jobs to fail.
> I couldn't stop the java processes, because of the ssh issue, so I was helpless until I could actually power down these nodes.
> restarting the cluster doesn't help, even when removing the bad nodes from the slaves file - they just reconnect and are accepted.
> while we plan to avoid tasks from launching on the same nodes over and over, what I'd like is to be able to prevent rogue processes from connecting to the masters.
> Ideally, the slaves file will contain an 'exclude' section, which will list nodes that shouldn't be accessed, and should be ignored if they try to connect. That would also help in configuring the slaves file for a large cluster - I'd list the full range of machines in the cluster, then list the ones that are down in the 'exclude' section

Parallel data/socket writing for DFSOutputStream
------------------------------------------------

                 Key: HADOOP-445
                 URL: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-445
             Project: Hadoop
          Issue Type: Improvement
    Affects Versions: 0.5.0
            Reporter: Benjamin Reed
         Attachments: fastClientWrite.patch

Currently, as DFS clients output blocks they write the entire block to disk before starting to transmit to the datanode. By writing to disk the client is able to retry a block write if the datanode files in the middle of a block transfer. Writing to disk and then to the datanode adds latency. Hopefully, the common case is that block transfers to datanodes are successful. This patch writes to the datanode and the disk in parallel. If the write to the datanode fails, it falls back to current behavior.

In my tests of transmits of 237M and 946M datasets using -copyFromLocal I'm seeing a 20-25% improvement in throughput.

-------------------------------------------------

                 Key: HADOOP-446
                 URL: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-446
             Project: Hadoop
          Issue Type: Bug
          Components: dfs
    Affects Versions: 0.5.0
            Reporter: Benjamin Reed
            Priority: Minor


In the overall scheme of things this is probably a nit, but in the run() method of DataXceiveServer in DataNode.java the method "data.checkDataDir()" is called right after the socket accept. data.checkDataDir() is a sanity check that makes sure the data directory is setup properly. It is a good sanity check to do when the server is started, but it seems like a bit of a waste to do it after every socket accept. If something happens that causes the sanity check to fail, you would end up finding out about it during the processing of the request anyway.

Owen O'Malley commented on HADOOP-263:
--------------------------------------

A couple of points:
   1. I'd express the start times as absolute times and the others as relative times in hours, minutes and seconds.
   2. the web ui shouldn't include shuffle & sort time columns for map tasks.
   3. "blank" times should be written as "&nbsp;" in the html so that the browsers make the box for the cell.
   4. usually, when you are creating format objects, you keep them in static fields rather than creating them on each call.
   5. the start times should be when the task starts running not when the job is submitted
   6. the shuffle time is never being set

eric baldeschwieler commented on HADOOP-181:
--------------------------------------------

Oh a whole thread can be had on this I'm sure!

Why does one turn off speculative execution?  Presumably because a MAP has unmanaged side-effects?

But... the framework still will rerun jobs if they complete and then the node is lost, right?  Won't this tickle exactly the same issues that speculative execution raised anyway?

Doesn't this imply that disallowing speculative execution is basically not the right mechanism to deal with the side-effect issue and that this deserves a rethink?

--------------------------------------------

On reintegrating lost task trackers...

It does seem like we should do this to me, but we need to make sure we reason through how this effects corner cases, what invariants the system does maintain and so on.

I suggest we work this through, and then go forward with this patch (modified if we find any corner cases) and post the reasoning, so we can review it as this logic evolves.  (And update any existing documentation in this area of course...)

Oh a whole thread can be had on this I'm sure!

Why does one turn off speculative execution?  Presumably because a  
MAP has unmanaged side-effects?

But... the framework still will rerun jobs if they complete and then  
the node is lost, right?  Won't this tickle exactly the same issues  
that speculative execution raised anyway?

Doesn't this imply that disallowing speculative execution is  
basically not the right mechanism to deal with the side-effect issue  
and that this deserves a rethink?

(RESEND, MENT TO ATTACH THE COMMENT BELOW TO THIS POSTING)

Why don't we include documenting this as part of the the "map-reduce  
walk-through" sprint item?

-----
On reintegrating lost task trackers...

It does seem like we should do this to me, but we need to make sure  
we reason through how this effects corner cases, what invariants the  
system does maintain and so on.

I suggest we work this through, and then go forward with this patch  
(modified if we find any corner cases) and post the reasoning, so we  
can review it as this logic evolves.  (And update any existing  
documentation in this area of course...)

+1 on undelete.  Move the deleted files into a special place and start 
actually deleting them when the disk space is low.  If the space gets 
low only on few nodes, and the load is not high, the blocks from 
deleted files may be re-replicated to other nodes, -- or the 
replication factor of deleted files may be decreased.

Snapshot seems an orthogonal functionality with a whole bunch of 
independent requruirements

Owen O'Malley commented on HADOOP-54:
-------------------------------------

I have a couple of comments. I had more, but jira ate them.

(It really sucks that jira throws your comment away if your login times out. *sigh*)

1. The Writer class should have the unneeded compression stuff taken out.
2. The Writer.compressed and blockCompressed fields should be taken out and replaced with methods.
3. The sync bytes in the block compressed writer should be written before the block rather than after (except for the first block). The goal is to get them between blocks, you don't really want one at the end (or beginning) of the file.
4. The CompressedBytes class should be private.
5. The private Writer constructor on line 307 is not used.
6. The static field VERSION_4 should be renamed to BLOCK_COMPRESS_VERSION and it should be marked final.
7. I'd rename the "byte[] version" to "syncBlock" and make a new field "byte version" that will contain just the last byte, which is the file version.
8. We really need to move to the Text class instead of UTF8. This has a couple of changes:
  A.  in writeFileHeader, the "new UTF8(...).write(out);" should be "Text.writeString(out, ...);"
  B. in init, reading the class names strings is the reverse: keyClass = Text.readString(in);
  C. we have to support the UTF8 string encodings for old file versions, so you'll need to switch behavior based on the version we are reading.

> SequenceFile will optionally compress individual values.  But both compression and performance would be much better if sequences of keys and values are compressed together.  Sync marks should only be placed between blocks.  This will require some changes to MapFile too, so that all file positions stored there are the positions of blocks, not entries within blocks.  Probably this can be accomplished by adding a getBlockStartPosition() method to SequenceFile.Writer.

          Components: dfs
            Reporter: Benjamin Reed


getBlockSize() does not check for an absolute path like the rest of the DistributeFileSystem API does. Consequently getBlockSize(Path) does not work with relative paths.

          Issue Type: Bug
            Reporter: Benjamin Reed


DistributedFileSystem initializes the working directory to be new Path("/user", System.getProperty("user.name")); rather than new Path("/user", conf.get("user.name")); the initialization would have to be moved to the constructor to access conf.

If relative paths are used, the remote tasks and JobTracker will use the uid they are running with rather than the id of the user that submitted the job.

Generalize the SequenceFileInputFilter to apply to any InputFormat
------------------------------------------------------------------

                 Key: HADOOP-449
                 URL: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-449
             Project: Hadoop
          Issue Type: Improvement
          Components: mapred
    Affects Versions: 0.5.0
            Reporter: Owen O'Malley
         Assigned To: Owen O'Malley
             Fix For: 0.6.0


I'd like to generalize the SequenceFileInputFormat that was introduced in HADOOP-412 so that it can be applied to any InputFormat. To do this, I propose:

interface WritableFilter {
   boolean accept(Writable item);
}

class FilterInputFormat implements InputFormat {
  ...
}

FilterInputFormat would look in the JobConf for:
   mapred.input.filter.source = the underlying input format
   mapred.input.filter.filters = a list of class names that implement WritableFilter

The FilterInputFormat will work like the current SequenceFilter, but use an internal RecordReader rather than the SequenceFile. This will require adding a next(key) and getCurrentValue(value) to the RecordReader interface, but that will be addressed in a different issue.

Doug Cutting commented on HADOOP-181:
-------------------------------------

> Why does one turn off speculative execution?

In the case of the Nutch crawler, speculative execution is disabled to observe politeness.  We do not want two tasks to attempt to fetch pages from a site at the same time.

This patch adds a fair amount of complexity, introducing a new state for tasks (presumed dead, but reanimateable).  A new state is likely to add new failure modes.

Does anyone deny that this primarily addresses an issue that would go away if we could more reliably detect tasktracker death?  Shouldn't we attempt to fix that first?  Sameer raises the issue of "transient network problems".  Are we actually seeing these?  Even if these were to occur, the system would operate correctly as-is: this is an optimization.  Is this a common-enough case that we can afford to optimize it?

Doug Cutting commented on HADOOP-64:
------------------------------------

Since we only expect to have around 10k blocks per node, storing the table in memory should not be a problem.  With even 100k blockids per nodem, at 100bytes of RAM per blockid, a datanode would only require 10MB.  So optimizing this seems premature.

> The dfs Datanode can only store data on a single filesystem volume. When a node runs its disks JBOD this means running a Datanode per disk on the machine. While the scheme works reasonably well on small clusters, on larger installations (several 100 nodes) it implies a very large number of Datanodes with associated management overhead in the Namenode.
> The Datanod should be enhanced to be able to handle multiple volumes on a single machine.

Doug Cutting commented on HADOOP-433:
-------------------------------------

Are you proposing that we should add a getSplit() method to RecordReader?  Then the progress wrapper could delegate to provide the original split.  Would that suffice?

BTW, do we have an issue anywhere to add a generic Split interface?  I couldn't find one.

> The record reader has access to the FileSplit which can in turn have information that is useful to the Mapper. For example, Map processing may vary according to file name or attributes associated with a file. Unfortunately, even using a MapRunner you only have access to the progress wrapper of the RecordReader. To get access to the real record reader I had to use a thread local variable which I set in RecordReader.getNext(). It would be much nicer if you could get a reference to the real RecordReader from the RecordReader passed to MapRunner.

Doug Cutting commented on HADOOP-435:
-------------------------------------

I think moving much of the logic from bin/hadoop into Java is a good idea.  We still need scripts to manage daemons, but client operation would be simplified.

I don't see your start and stop scripts here.

Specifying a conf directory could be done by manipulating the class loader or classpath, rather than adding a lot of special case code.

Shouldn't we standardize on commons-cli for command-line processing?  Shouldn't this somehow integrate with the Tool and ToolBase stuff?

> Currently, hadoop is a set of scripts, configurations, and jar files. It makes it a pain to install on compute and datanodes. It also makes it a pain to setup clients so that they can use hadoop. Everytime things are updated the pain begins again.
> I suggest that we should be able to build a single Jar file that has a Main-Class defined with the configuration built in so that we can distribute that one file to nodes and clients on updates. One nice thing that I haven't done would be to make the jarfile downloadable from the JobTracker webpage so that clients can easily submit the jobs.
> I currently use such a setup on my small cluster. To start the job tracker I used "java -jar hadoop.jar -l /tmp/log jobtracker" to submit a job I use "java -jar hadoop.jar jar wordcount.jar". I used the client on my linux and Mac OSX machines and I'll I need installed in java and the hadoop.jar file.
> hadoop.jar helps with logfiles and configurations. The default of pulling the config files from the jar file can be overridden by specifying a config directory so that you can easily have machine specific configs and still have the same hadoop.jar on all machines.
> Here are the available commands from hadoop.jar:
> USAGE: hadoop [-l logdir] command
>   User commands:
>     dfs          run a DFS admin client
>     jar          run a JAR file
>     job          manipulate MapReduce jobs
>     fsck         run a DFS filesystem check utility
>   Runtime startup commands:
>     datanode     run a DFS datanode
>     jobtracker   run the MapReduce job Tracker node
>     namenode     run the DFS namenode (namenode -format formats the FS)
>     tasktracker  run a MapReduce task Tracker node
>   HadoopLoader commands:
>     buildJar     builds the HadoopLoader jar file
>     conf         dump hadoop configuration
> Note, I don't have the classes for hadoop streaming built into this Jar file, but if I had that would also be an option (it checks for needed classes before displaying an option). It makes it very easy for users that just write scripts to use hadoop straight from their machines.
> I'm also attaching the start.sh and stop.sh scripts that I use. These are the only scripts I use to startup the daemons. They are very simple and the start.sh script uses the config file to figure out whether or not to start the jobtracker and the nameserver.
> The attached patch adds the HadoopIt patch, modifies the Configuration class to find the config files correctly, and modifies the build to make a fully contained hadoop.jar. To update the configuration in a hadoop.jar you simply use "zip hadoop.jar hadoop-site.xml".

Doug Cutting commented on HADOOP-442:
-------------------------------------

The slaves file is currently only used by the start/stop scripts, so it won't help here.

Perhaps the jobtracker and namenode should have a public API that permits particular hosts to be banned.  Then the web ui could then use this to let adminstrators ban hosts.  We could initialize the list from a config file, in the case of persistently bad hosts.

> I recently had a few nodes go bad, such that they were inaccessible to ssh, but were still running their java processes.
> tasks that executed on them were failing, causing jobs to fail.
> I couldn't stop the java processes, because of the ssh issue, so I was helpless until I could actually power down these nodes.
> restarting the cluster doesn't help, even when removing the bad nodes from the slaves file - they just reconnect and are accepted.
> while we plan to avoid tasks from launching on the same nodes over and over, what I'd like is to be able to prevent rogue processes from connecting to the masters.
> Ideally, the slaves file will contain an 'exclude' section, which will list nodes that shouldn't be accessed, and should be ignored if they try to connect. That would also help in configuring the slaves file for a large cluster - I'd list the full range of machines in the cluster, then list the ones that are down in the 'exclude' section

Benjamin Reed commented on HADOOP-433:
--------------------------------------

getSplit() would address my need. However, I can imagine in the future that we would like access to the RecordReader(), especially if we wanted to do sophisticated things like record skipping using indexed files or random sampling. The MapRunner interface makes these kind of interesting accesses easy to do if you had access to a RecordReader that happens to implement a more full featured interface.

A more generic Split interface would be nice as well :)

> The record reader has access to the FileSplit which can in turn have information that is useful to the Mapper. For example, Map processing may vary according to file name or attributes associated with a file. Unfortunately, even using a MapRunner you only have access to the progress wrapper of the RecordReader. To get access to the real record reader I had to use a thread local variable which I set in RecordReader.getNext(). It would be much nicer if you could get a reference to the real RecordReader from the RecordReader passed to MapRunner.

Owen O'Malley commented on HADOOP-448:
--------------------------------------

No, this works fine.

Before the task is run, the TaskRunner does a setWorkingDirectory to the working directory of the job. I always use relative path names in my map/reduce jobs and it works fine, even when a different user runs the servers.

> DistributedFileSystem initializes the working directory to be new Path("/user", System.getProperty("user.name")); rather than new Path("/user", conf.get("user.name")); the initialization would have to be moved to the constructor to access conf.
> If relative paths are used, the remote tasks and JobTracker will use the uid they are running with rather than the id of the user that submitted the job.

Benjamin Reed updated HADOOP-435:
---------------------------------

    Attachment: start.sh

This script starts up a datanode and tasktracker. If the config indicates that the node is the jobtracker, it also starts the jobtracker and namenode.

> Currently, hadoop is a set of scripts, configurations, and jar files. It makes it a pain to install on compute and datanodes. It also makes it a pain to setup clients so that they can use hadoop. Everytime things are updated the pain begins again.
> I suggest that we should be able to build a single Jar file that has a Main-Class defined with the configuration built in so that we can distribute that one file to nodes and clients on updates. One nice thing that I haven't done would be to make the jarfile downloadable from the JobTracker webpage so that clients can easily submit the jobs.
> I currently use such a setup on my small cluster. To start the job tracker I used "java -jar hadoop.jar -l /tmp/log jobtracker" to submit a job I use "java -jar hadoop.jar jar wordcount.jar". I used the client on my linux and Mac OSX machines and I'll I need installed in java and the hadoop.jar file.
> hadoop.jar helps with logfiles and configurations. The default of pulling the config files from the jar file can be overridden by specifying a config directory so that you can easily have machine specific configs and still have the same hadoop.jar on all machines.
> Here are the available commands from hadoop.jar:
> USAGE: hadoop [-l logdir] command
>   User commands:
>     dfs          run a DFS admin client
>     jar          run a JAR file
>     job          manipulate MapReduce jobs
>     fsck         run a DFS filesystem check utility
>   Runtime startup commands:
>     datanode     run a DFS datanode
>     jobtracker   run the MapReduce job Tracker node
>     namenode     run the DFS namenode (namenode -format formats the FS)
>     tasktracker  run a MapReduce task Tracker node
>   HadoopLoader commands:
>     buildJar     builds the HadoopLoader jar file
>     conf         dump hadoop configuration
> Note, I don't have the classes for hadoop streaming built into this Jar file, but if I had that would also be an option (it checks for needed classes before displaying an option). It makes it very easy for users that just write scripts to use hadoop straight from their machines.
> I'm also attaching the start.sh and stop.sh scripts that I use. These are the only scripts I use to startup the daemons. They are very simple and the start.sh script uses the config file to figure out whether or not to start the jobtracker and the nameserver.
> The attached patch adds the HadoopIt patch, modifies the Configuration class to find the config files correctly, and modifies the build to make a fully contained hadoop.jar. To update the configuration in a hadoop.jar you simply use "zip hadoop.jar hadoop-site.xml".

Doug Cutting commented on HADOOP-445:
-------------------------------------

It used to work the way you propose.

http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=390262

As I recall, the TestFileSystem benchmark was much more reliable after this patch.

You say that this improves serial write performance, but how does it affect overall MapReduce job performance on a large cluster?

> Currently, as DFS clients output blocks they write the entire block to disk before starting to transmit to the datanode. By writing to disk the client is able to retry a block write if the datanode files in the middle of a block transfer. Writing to disk and then to the datanode adds latency. Hopefully, the common case is that block transfers to datanodes are successful. This patch writes to the datanode and the disk in parallel. If the write to the datanode fails, it falls back to current behavior.
> In my tests of transmits of 237M and 946M datasets using -copyFromLocal I'm seeing a 20-25% improvement in throughput.

Remove the need for users to specify the types of the inputs
------------------------------------------------------------

                 Key: HADOOP-450
                 URL: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-450
             Project: Hadoop
          Issue Type: Improvement
          Components: mapred
    Affects Versions: 0.5.0
            Reporter: Owen O'Malley
         Assigned To: Owen O'Malley
             Fix For: 0.6.0


Currently, the application specifies the types of the input keys and values and the RecordReader checks them for consistency. It would make more sense to have the RecordReader define the types of keys that it will produce. Therefore, I propose that we add two new methods to RecordReader:

WritableComparable createKey();
Writable createValue();

Note that I propose adding them to the RecordReader rather than the InputFormat, so that they can specific to a particular input split.

Benjamin Reed commented on HADOOP-435:
--------------------------------------

I've attached the scripts. They are quite convenient to use. To start the cluster I simply do "for i in `cat machines'; do ssh $i:hadoop/start.sh hadoop/hadoop.jar; done". I stop everything using "for i in `cat machines'; do ssh $i:hadoop/stop.sh hadoop/hadoop.jar; done"

The start script currently assumes that the jobtracker and namenode run on the same machine. The namenode should only be started if the machine is the namenode as indicated by the configuration just like jobtracker. There should also be a flag to indicate whether a datanode and tasktracker should be started if the host is a jobtracker or namenode. Despite the limitation, hopefully you get the point :)

The nice thing about using a conf dir is that you don't have to worry about complicated classpaths. I don't usually use it since I generally just use the config in the jar file, but there are cases where it is convenient. Fortunately, the code is structured such that the special case code is in a single method.

I'm not familiar enough with Tool and ToolBase to know how well it fits. From the brief look I took it seemed to address a more specific kind of application. (I wouldn't feel bad if someone made it use Tool and ToolBase :)

--------------------------------------

Okay, I guess the problem is that JobTracker does not call setWorkingDirectory() before invoking the InputFormat. (That is where I hit this problem.) If we did the initialization properly in DistributedFileSystem, we wouldn't have to worry about calling setWorkingDirectory()

> If relative paths are used, the remote tasks and JobTracker will use the uid they are running with rather than the id of the user that submitted the job.

Doug Cutting commented on HADOOP-435:
-------------------------------------

Are you proposing that these should replace hadoop-daemon.sh?  Your start/stop scripts lack many features of hadoop-daemon.sh, like using a pid file to keep from starting multiple daemons of the same type on a host, optionally rsyncing code from a master, specifying jvm options, etc.

Add a Split interface
---------------------

                 Key: HADOOP-451
                 URL: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-451
             Project: Hadoop
          Issue Type: Improvement
          Components: mapred
            Reporter: Doug Cutting
             Fix For: 0.6.0


The InputFormat interface has a method:

FileSplit[] getSplits();

This should change to:

Split[] getSplits();

The Split interface would look like:

public interface Split extends Writable {

  /** Returns a list of hosts that contain this split.
       This is only used to optimize task placement, so this may be empty. */
  String[] getLocations(FileSystem fs);

  /** The relative, estimated cost of operating on this.  Typically the size of the data in the split.
       Used to prioritize tasks in a job (high-cost tasks are run first).  */
   long getCost();
}

Marco Nicosia commented on HADOOP-442:
--------------------------------------

Would it be better to choose either one or the other to be authoritative for all operations?

1] The namenode/jobtrackers maintain the slaves file. Membership and other administrative functions are made via API calls to the process, which modifies a file on disk. That file is used, but never modified, by slaves.sh, etc. If the file is still text, it can be modified between process restarts.

2] The namenode/jobtrackers observe and respect the contents of a file on disk. Standard tools can modify it, but the processes would have to poll the file to see if it has been changed.

I personally prefer #1, tho I'd hope that any API is open (XML-RPC, REST, SOAP...) instead of RMI so that any set of sysadmin automation can talk to it.

> I recently had a few nodes go bad, such that they were inaccessible to ssh, but were still running their java processes.
> tasks that executed on them were failing, causing jobs to fail.
> I couldn't stop the java processes, because of the ssh issue, so I was helpless until I could actually power down these nodes.
> restarting the cluster doesn't help, even when removing the bad nodes from the slaves file - they just reconnect and are accepted.
> while we plan to avoid tasks from launching on the same nodes over and over, what I'd like is to be able to prevent rogue processes from connecting to the masters.
> Ideally, the slaves file will contain an 'exclude' section, which will list nodes that shouldn't be accessed, and should be ignored if they try to connect. That would also help in configuring the slaves file for a large cluster - I'd list the full range of machines in the cluster, then list the ones that are down in the 'exclude' section

Konstantin Shvachko updated HADOOP-306:
---------------------------------------

    Attachment: FSImageSaveDNInfo.patch

This patch implements a part of the laid out design.
It stores the historical list of datanodes in the image file and logs newly
registered nodes in the edits file.
The changes are mostly related to the FSNamesystem class.
Since datanodes are not removed from the datanodeMap when they are considered
non responsive, the deadDatanodeMap field becomes redundant. I removed it.
There is a change in semantics of the relation between heartbeats and datanodeMap maps.
heartbeats contains only live nodes while datanodeMap contains both alive and dead nodes.
See JavaDoc for more details.
So when we are looking for new targets for block replication we should check the heartbeats
map rather than the datanodeMap as we did before.
Also since the DatanodeDescriptors are not physically removed from datanodeMap
I had to add their blocks cleanup while processing lost heartbeats.
Some changes to the FSImage and FSEditLog classes. I removed unnecessary
parameter to FSDirectory from the previous version. The whole name space can be
accessed via static method FSNamesystem.getFSNamesystem()

> This is a proposal to improve DFS cluster startup process.
> The data node startup procedures were described and implemented in HADOOP-124.
> I'm trying to extend them to the name node here.
> The main idea is to introduce safe mode, which can be entered manually for administration
> purposes, or automatically when a configurable threshold of active data nodes is breached,
> or at startup when the node stays in safe mode until the minimal limit of active
> nodes is reached.
> This are high level requirements intended to improve the name node and cluster reliability.
>     = The name node safe mode means that the name node is not changing the state of the
>        file system. Meta data is read-only, and block replication / removal is not taking place.
>     = In safe mode the name node accepts data node registrations and
>        processes their block reports.
>     = The name node always starts in safe mode and stays safe until the majority
>         (a configurable parameter: safemode.threshold) of data nodes (or blocks?)
>         is reported.
>     = The name node can also fall into safe mode when the number of non-active
>         (heartbeats stopped coming in) data nodes becomes critical.
>     = The startup "silent period", when the name node is in safe mode and is
>         not issuing any block requests to the data nodes, is initially set to a
>         configurable value safemode.timeout.increment. By the end of the timeout
>         the name node checks the safemode.threshold and decides whether to switch
>         to the normal mode or to stay in safe. If the normal mode criteria is not
>         met, then the silent period is extended by incrementing the safemode timeout.
>     = The name node stays in safe mode not longer than a configurable value of
>         safemode.timeout.max, in which case it logs missing data nodes and shuts
>         itself down.
>     = When the name node switches to normal mode it checks whether all required
>         data nodes have actually registered, based on the list of active data storages
>         from the last session. Then it logs missing nodes, if any, and starts
>         replicating and/or deleting blocks as required.
>     = A historical list of data storages (nodes) ever registered with the cluster is
>         persistently stored in the image and log files. The list is used in two ways:
>         a) at startup to verify whether all nodes have registered, and to report
>         missing nodes;
>         b) at runtime if a data node registers with a new storage id the
>         name node verifies that no new blocks are reported from that storage,
>         which would prevent us from accidentally connecting data nodes from a
>         different cluster.
>     = The name node should have an option to run in safe mode. Starting with
>         that option would mean it never leaves safe mode.
>         This is useful for testing the cluster.
>     = Data nodes that can not connect to the name node for a long time (configurable)
>         should shut down themselves.

Benjamin Reed commented on HADOOP-435:
--------------------------------------

I'm not suggesting that we use my scripts to replace the hadoop scripts, I'm just showing how things can be simplified in some cases. One of the daunting things to me (yes I'm simple minded) was getting hadoop setup and running on my little cluster. With the encapsulated jar file you can actually just copy the file into a shared directory and start everything up to at least try it. (It's also very nice to quickly test things.)

If you use the encapsulated jar file, the only thing you need to rsync is a single jar: hadoop.jar, so you simplify things.

The point of the scripts is to show that in some cases you may not need the web of scripts to manage hadoop. Especially for those just playing with hadoop or using some other process management system such as Condor. The encapsulated jar file allows for a convenient way to deploy a cluster: you plunk down the jar file and run it.

In the current distribution the only thing that would change would be the hadoop script, which would basically become a single line.

> Currently, hadoop is a set of scripts, configurations, and jar files. It makes it a pain to install on compute and datanodes. It also makes it a pain to setup clients so that they can use hadoop. Everytime things are updated the pain begins again.
> I suggest that we should be able to build a single Jar file that has a Main-Class defined with the configuration built in so that we can distribute that one file to nodes and clients on updates. One nice thing that I haven't done would be to make the jarfile downloadable from the JobTracker webpage so that clients can easily submit the jobs.
> I currently use such a setup on my small cluster. To start the job tracker I used "java -jar hadoop.jar -l /tmp/log jobtracker" to submit a job I use "java -jar hadoop.jar jar wordcount.jar". I used the client on my linux and Mac OSX machines and I'll I need installed in java and the hadoop.jar file.
> hadoop.jar helps with logfiles and configurations. The default of pulling the config files from the jar file can be overridden by specifying a config directory so that you can easily have machine specific configs and still have the same hadoop.jar on all machines.
> Here are the available commands from hadoop.jar:
> USAGE: hadoop [-l logdir] command
>   User commands:
>     dfs          run a DFS admin client
>     jar          run a JAR file
>     job          manipulate MapReduce jobs
>     fsck         run a DFS filesystem check utility
>   Runtime startup commands:
>     datanode     run a DFS datanode
>     jobtracker   run the MapReduce job Tracker node
>     namenode     run the DFS namenode (namenode -format formats the FS)
>     tasktracker  run a MapReduce task Tracker node
>   HadoopLoader commands:
>     buildJar     builds the HadoopLoader jar file
>     conf         dump hadoop configuration
> Note, I don't have the classes for hadoop streaming built into this Jar file, but if I had that would also be an option (it checks for needed classes before displaying an option). It makes it very easy for users that just write scripts to use hadoop straight from their machines.
> I'm also attaching the start.sh and stop.sh scripts that I use. These are the only scripts I use to startup the daemons. They are very simple and the start.sh script uses the config file to figure out whether or not to start the jobtracker and the nameserver.
> The attached patch adds the HadoopIt patch, modifies the Configuration class to find the config files correctly, and modifies the build to make a fully contained hadoop.jar. To update the configuration in a hadoop.jar you simply use "zip hadoop.jar hadoop-site.xml".

Benjamin Reed commented on HADOOP-445:
--------------------------------------

You are right. It is the same. What was the performance difference you saw after the patch?

There actually is a problem with head contention in the common case that happens with my patch. When a client is writing to a datanode running on the same machine, depending on the configuration, the backup file and the datanode could be contending for the disk head. In reality, if the client is talking to a local datanode, something we try to make happen, we should not write to the backup file, which should also give us another performance boost.

> Currently, as DFS clients output blocks they write the entire block to disk before starting to transmit to the datanode. By writing to disk the client is able to retry a block write if the datanode files in the middle of a block transfer. Writing to disk and then to the datanode adds latency. Hopefully, the common case is that block transfers to datanodes are successful. This patch writes to the datanode and the disk in parallel. If the write to the datanode fails, it falls back to current behavior.
> In my tests of transmits of 237M and 946M datasets using -copyFromLocal I'm seeing a 20-25% improvement in throughput.

Owen O'Malley updated HADOOP-450:
---------------------------------

    Status: Patch Available  (was: Open)

This patch does:
  1. depriciates the JobConf methods for get/set key/value type
  2. adds createKey/Value to the RecordReader
  3. changes TextInputFormat to use Text rather than UTF8
  4. cleans up the uses with examples, lib, and streaming.

> Currently, the application specifies the types of the input keys and values and the RecordReader checks them for consistency. It would make more sense to have the RecordReader define the types of keys that it will produce. Therefore, I propose that we add two new methods to RecordReader:
> WritableComparable createKey();
> Writable createValue();
> Note that I propose adding them to the RecordReader rather than the InputFormat, so that they can specific to a particular input split.

Bryan Pendleton commented on HADOOP-451:
----------------------------------------

You will probably need to add a "setSplitClass" and "getSplitClass" to JobConf to go along with this. Splits need to be Writables, but there's no automatic polymorphism/factory for Writables yet.

Adding caching to Hadoop which is independent of the task trackers.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

                 Key: HADOOP-452
                 URL: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-452
             Project: Hadoop
          Issue Type: New Feature
            Reporter: Mahadev konar
            Priority: Minor


It would be nice to have a feature in Hadoop that could cache files locally that is independent of TaskTrackers and JobTrackers. Hadoop-288 caching is dependent on the tasktrackers. In an environment where you would dynamically bring up and down the TaskTrackers for resource sharing, that is problematic. It would be good to have this feature wherein you can install tasktrackers/jobtrackers on these machines using this caching mechanism. The caching feature could use something like Bittorent /http/rsync to copy the main hadoop.jar.

Owen O'Malley commented on HADOOP-181:
--------------------------------------

I agree that the original desire for this patch was born of the TaskTracker timeouts that shouldn't happen. Fixing those problems (and we _have_ fixed most of them over the last 4 months) should take precendence. However, that said, I think in the long term, we do want something like this patch. If a switch goes down for 15 minutes and then comes back up, it does not make sense to reshuffle, resort, and rerun a reduce that takes hours to run.

All map/reduce applications, even those with speculative execution turned off, must permit redundant copies of their tasks for precisely this reason. In this case, the JobTracker has decided a given task is dead, but hasn't been able to tell the responsible TaskTracker yet. Therefore it schedules another instance of the failed task on a different node. Therefore, they are going to run in parallel for a while.

I guess for now, let's sit on this patch and contemplate what the model should be for dealing with communication problems. We should also monitor this in real use and see how often task trackers are being lost and probably put some effort to determine at least whether it is the job tracker or the task tracker that is the cause of the delay.

> TaskTrackers should not close and restart themselves for having a late heartbeat. The JobTracker should just accept their current status.

Runping Qi commented on HADOOP-403:
-----------------------------------


In my app, I added an OutputCollector variable (and a Reporter variable if necessary) in my Map/Reduce classes so that the close method can access them. Those variables are assigned only once my the first call to Map/Reduce method.

If the framework should offer help here, we can introduce to Closable a method setCollector(OutputCollector) and setReporter(Reporter). When the framework creates a Mapper/Reducer object, it calls these methods.

> For mappers with side-effects, or mappers that work as aggregators (i.e. no output on individual key-value pairs, but an aggregate output at the end of all key-value pairs), output should be performed in the close method. For this purpose, we need to supply output collector and reporter to the close method of Mapper. This involves interface change, though. Thoughts ?

Runping Qi commented on HADOOP-372:
-----------------------------------


It would be great if we make it optional for the user to specify key/value classes for the inputs.
Theses classes, if specified by the user, would be used for validation check only. That way, the framework will get the input key/value class info from the the input files alone. That will be very robust. 

Assuming that all records in each split will have the same key/value classes, then the framework can determine the appropriate mapper class upfront, and call the map function of that mapper class, thus the map function does not need to call instanceof method. 

The split will not be static. The only constraint is that a split will not span across multiple files, which is true now.

> Right now, the user can specify multiple input directories for a map reduce job. 
> However, the files under all the directories are assumed to be in the same format, 
> with the same key/value classes. This proves to be  a serious limit in many situations. 
> Here is an example. Suppose I have three simple tables: 
> one has URLs and their rank values (page ranks), 
> another has URLs and their classification values, 
> and the third one has the URL meta data such as crawl status, last crawl time, etc. 
> Suppose now I need a job to generate a list of URLs to be crawled next. 
> The decision depends on the info in all the three tables.
> Right now, there is no easy way to accomplish this.
> However, this job can be done if the framework allows to specify different inputformats for different input dirs.
> Suppose my three tables are in the following directory respectively: rankTable, classificationTable. and metaDataTable. 
> If we extend JobConf class with the following method (as Owen suggested to me):
>     addInputPath(aPath, anInputFormatClass, anInputKeyClass, anInputValueClass)
> Then I can specify my job as follows:
>     addInputPath(rankTable, SequenceFileInputFormat.class, UTF8.class, DoubleWritable.class)
>     addInputPath(classificationTable, TextInputFormat.class, UTF8,class, UTF8.class)
>     addInputPath(metaDataTable, SequenceFileInputFormat.class, UTF8.class, MyRecord.class)
> If an input directory is added through the current API, it will have the same meaning as it is now. 
> Thus this extension will not affect any applications that do not need this new feature.
> It is relatively easy for the M/R framework to create an appropriate record reader for a map task based on the above information.
> And that is the only change needed for supporting this extension.

hadoop du optionally behave like unix's du -s
---------------------------------------------

                 Key: HADOOP-454
                 URL: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-454
             Project: Hadoop
          Issue Type: New Feature
          Components: dfs
    Affects Versions: 0.5.0
            Reporter: Marco Nicosia
            Priority: Trivial


In Unix, the user has the option to specify a -s flag:
     -s      Display an entry for each specified file.  (Equivalent to -d 0)

Instead of providing data for the subdirectories of the arguments, du prints the total usage of each argument, without printing subdirectories.

This is very convenient for those looking to find how much space is used by a particular branch, without requring them to add up all the sub-usages.

Doug Cutting commented on HADOOP-445:
-------------------------------------

> What was the performance difference you saw after the patch?

I think the performance was about the same, mostly things just became more reliable, since the longer-lived connections caused lots more timeouts.

> Currently, as DFS clients output blocks they write the entire block to disk before starting to transmit to the datanode. By writing to disk the client is able to retry a block write if the datanode files in the middle of a block transfer. Writing to disk and then to the datanode adds latency. Hopefully, the common case is that block transfers to datanodes are successful. This patch writes to the datanode and the disk in parallel. If the write to the datanode fails, it falls back to current behavior.
> In my tests of transmits of 237M and 946M datasets using -copyFromLocal I'm seeing a 20-25% improvement in throughput.

> Currently, the application specifies the types of the input keys and values and the RecordReader checks them for consistency. It would make more sense to have the RecordReader define the types of keys that it will produce. Therefore, I propose that we add two new methods to RecordReader:
> WritableComparable createKey();
> Writable createValue();
> Note that I propose adding them to the RecordReader rather than the InputFormat, so that they can specific to a particular input split.

-------------------------------------

> You will probably need to add a "setSplitClass" and "getSplitClass" to JobConf 

The InputFormat is a Split factory, no?  Who else would need to create Splits?

Splits are passed in RPCs, and the RPC mechanism supports polymorphism.  Splits are not written to files, so I see no reason to declare a fixed class per job.  Am I missing something?

Doug Cutting commented on HADOOP-181:
-------------------------------------

> If a switch goes down for 15 minutes [ ... ]

We'll currently have a lot of other problems if a switch goes down for 15 minutes.  All of the other tasks will probably fail because DFS will no longer have complete copies of files.

Is a switch going down for 15 minutes really a case we need to optimize?  Is it acceptable to lose a few hours work on its hosts when a switch dies?  When a switch fails, how long does it take to replace?

We can answer some of this fairly precisely.  What is the MTBF for switches?  How many switches would we have in a 10k-node system?

Doug Cutting commented on HADOOP-403:
-------------------------------------

I don't think we should make all future io.Closeable implementations deal with a mapred.OutputCollector.  I would prefer any such methods were added to a new interface, perhaps mapred.Output.

One can easily workaround this problem by specifying an alternate MapRunnable.  Is this issue really so common that this workaround, or Runping's, do not suffice?

> For mappers with side-effects, or mappers that work as aggregators (i.e. no output on individual key-value pairs, but an aggregate output at the end of all key-value pairs), output should be performed in the close method. For this purpose, we need to supply output collector and reporter to the close method of Mapper. This involves interface change, though. Thoughts ?

Runping Qi commented on HADOOP-450:
-----------------------------------


It seems to me that it is better to add getInputKeyClass/ValueClass methods to RecordReader, since creating an object of these class needs a 
reference to JobConf object and RecordReader does not have such a reference.
The MapRunner class can create the key/value objects by calling ReflectionUtil. MapRunner would look like:

  public void run(RecordReader input, OutputCollector output,
                  Reporter reporter)
    throws IOException {
    try {
      // allocate key & value instances that are re-used for all entries
        this.inputKeyClass = input.getKeyClass();
        this.inputValueClass = input.getValueClass();
      
        WritableComparable key =
          (WritableComparable)ReflectionUtils.newInstance(inputKeyClass, job);
        Writable value = (Writable)ReflectionUtils.newInstance(inputValueClass,
                                                             job);
        
        Class mapperClass = job.getMapperClassFor(this.inputKeyClass, this.inputValueClass);
        this.mapper = (Mapper)ReflectionUtils.newInstance(mapperClass, job);
        while (input.next(key, value)) {
        // map pair to output
        mapper.map(key, value, output, reporter);
      }
    } finally {
        mapper.close();
    }
  }

In the above code, the mapper class is obtained from the job object 
through a new method of JobConf class:
Class getMapperClassFor(this.inputKeyClass, this.inputValueClass);

With these, and a few other minor changes, this patch will address jira issue 372 as well.
The other changes include:

    add to JobConf class the following methods:
           public InputFormat getInputFormat(Path p) 
           public void setInputFormat(Class theClass, Path p)
           public Class getMapperClassFor(Class keyClass, Class valueClass) {
           public void setMapperClassFor(Class theClass, Class keyClass, Class valueClass)
   replace thefollowing in MapTask class:
      final RecordReader rawIn =                  // open input
        job.getInputFormat().getRecordReader
        (FileSystem.get(job), split, job, reporter);
  with 
      final RecordReader rawIn =                  // open input
        job.getInputFormat(split.getPath()).getRecordReader
        (FileSystem.get(job), split, job, reporter);
 

With these changes, the application will specify a MapReduce job in the following way:
            
        Configuration defaults = new Configuration();
        JobConf theJob = new JobConf(defaults, My.class);
        
        theJob.addInputPath(myInputPath_1)
        theJob.setInputFormat(SequenceFileInputFormat, myInputPath_1);

        theJob.addInputPath(myInputPath_2)
        theJob.setInputFormat(TextInputFormat, myInputPath_2);

        theJob.addInputPath(myInputPath_3)
        theJob.setInputFormat(SequenceFileInputFormat, myInputPath_3);

        theJob.setMapperClassFor(MapperClass_a, LongWritable.class, Text.class);
        theJob.setMapperClassFor(MapperClass_b, Key_1.class, Value_1.class);
        theJob.setMapperClassFor(MapperClass_c, Key_2.class, Value_2.class);

        ....

> Currently, the application specifies the types of the input keys and values and the RecordReader checks them for consistency. It would make more sense to have the RecordReader define the types of keys that it will produce. Therefore, I propose that we add two new methods to RecordReader:
> WritableComparable createKey();
> Writable createValue();
> Note that I propose adding them to the RecordReader rather than the InputFormat, so that they can specific to a particular input split.

-----------------------------------


Is there still a problem in commiting this patch?
I think the patch adds a good value to Hadoop APIs, and is pretty safe, since it does not affect the server side at all.

> In my applications, some jobs depend on the outputs of other jobs. Therefore, job dependency forms a DAG. A job is ready to run if and only if it does not have any dependency or all the jobs it depends are finished successfully. To help schedule and monitor a group of jobs like that, I am thinking of implementing a utility that:
> 	- accept jobs with dependency specification
>       - monitor job status
>       - submit jobs when they are ready
> With such a utility, the application can construct its jobs, specify their dependency and then hand the jobs to the utility class. The utility takes care of the details of job submission.
> I'll post my design skech for comments/suggestion.
> Eventually, I'll submit a patch for the utility.

Doug Cutting commented on HADOOP-450:
-------------------------------------

This issue is not about specifying multiple map functions per job.  That should be a separate issue.  This is just about moving the ownership of the key and value types from the job to the RecordReader.

I don't understand your objections to the proposed new RecordReader methods createKey() and createValue().  The RecordReader is created by InputFormat.getRecordReader(), which is passed a JobConf, so the RecordReader has access to a JobConf when it creates key and value instances.  The RecordReader can then use ReflectionUtils.newInstance()  to create configured instances.

Maybe I'm reading the code wrong.

It looks to me like the FileSplit that gets used by a MapTaskRunner comes
from the instantiation of a FileSplit in MapTask.java, which deserializes it
from a stream. In the very least, if MapTasks stay Writable, then that code
is wrong. I got the impression that the Task which ends up getting executed
goes through RPC this way. So, when a MapTask gets assigned, and the
readFields() gets called on the other end, it will be FileSplit.readFields()
getting called, with no awareness of the actual type of Split that was
present.

Now that I've run through that process, and assuming my spiel is correct -
then won't it be necessary to fix MapTask to correctly re-create the right
type of Split on deserialization?

> Currently, the application specifies the types of the input keys and values and the RecordReader checks them for consistency. It would make more sense to have the RecordReader define the types of keys that it will produce. Therefore, I propose that we add two new methods to RecordReader:
> WritableComparable createKey();
> Writable createValue();
> Note that I propose adding them to the RecordReader rather than the InputFormat, so that they can specific to a particular input split.

> In my applications, some jobs depend on the outputs of other jobs. Therefore, job dependency forms a DAG. A job is ready to run if and only if it does not have any dependency or all the jobs it depends are finished successfully. To help schedule and monitor a group of jobs like that, I am thinking of implementing a utility that:
> 	- accept jobs with dependency specification
>       - monitor job status
>       - submit jobs when they are ready
> With such a utility, the application can construct its jobs, specify their dependency and then hand the jobs to the utility class. The utility takes care of the details of job submission.
> I'll post my design skech for comments/suggestion.
> Eventually, I'll submit a patch for the utility.

Runping Qi commented on HADOOP-450:
-----------------------------------


I don't really object to add creatKey/Value methods to RecordReader. One way or another is fine. To add these methods, the RecordReader class needs to introduce a reference to conf object, which Owen did, and it is just fine.

I agree we should have a separate patch for Issue 372. With the patch for Issue 450, the patch for Issue 372 will be very simple.
If no body is working on Issue 372, I'd be happy to provide a patch for it.

Yoram Arnon commented on HADOOP-435:
------------------------------------

any start/stop mechanism must allow separate control of DFS and map-reduce, and separate nodes for namenode, jobtracker, datanodes and tasktrackers.
jvm options, the pid matter etc. are also required.

A trivial method for starting up a toy hadoop cluster would be very welcome, lowering the bar for new users, but let's be careful before removing any functionality, or changing the behavior of the hadoop script.

> In the getMapOutput.jsp, tracker.mapOutputLost is called irrespective of whether the sender of the map output threw an exception or the receiver died (thereby closing the socket causing the jsp to throw an exception). Invoking the method causes the corresponding map task to fail and causes it to be rescheduled but it may be the case that the problem is at the reciever's end. Need to do a better check of where the exception was thrown.

Benjamin Reed commented on HADOOP-435:
--------------------------------------

This does separate control of all the daemons just like the hadoop script. It encapsulates all the jar files, the configuration files (optionally), and most of the hadoop script into one self contained jar file. You still must start up each daemon separately. The command line arguments are the same as those for the hadoop script. No functionality is removed, I just added a bit more, like support for hadoopStreaming and the ability to dump the properties retrieved from the merged config files to standard out.

> This is a proposal to improve DFS cluster startup process.
> The data node startup procedures were described and implemented in HADOOP-124.
> I'm trying to extend them to the name node here.
> The main idea is to introduce safe mode, which can be entered manually for administration
> purposes, or automatically when a configurable threshold of active data nodes is breached,
> or at startup when the node stays in safe mode until the minimal limit of active
> nodes is reached.
> This are high level requirements intended to improve the name node and cluster reliability.
>     = The name node safe mode means that the name node is not changing the state of the
>        file system. Meta data is read-only, and block replication / removal is not taking place.
>     = In safe mode the name node accepts data node registrations and
>        processes their block reports.
>     = The name node always starts in safe mode and stays safe until the majority
>         (a configurable parameter: safemode.threshold) of data nodes (or blocks?)
>         is reported.
>     = The name node can also fall into safe mode when the number of non-active
>         (heartbeats stopped coming in) data nodes becomes critical.
>     = The startup "silent period", when the name node is in safe mode and is
>         not issuing any block requests to the data nodes, is initially set to a
>         configurable value safemode.timeout.increment. By the end of the timeout
>         the name node checks the safemode.threshold and decides whether to switch
>         to the normal mode or to stay in safe. If the normal mode criteria is not
>         met, then the silent period is extended by incrementing the safemode timeout.
>     = The name node stays in safe mode not longer than a configurable value of
>         safemode.timeout.max, in which case it logs missing data nodes and shuts
>         itself down.
>     = When the name node switches to normal mode it checks whether all required
>         data nodes have actually registered, based on the list of active data storages
>         from the last session. Then it logs missing nodes, if any, and starts
>         replicating and/or deleting blocks as required.
>     = A historical list of data storages (nodes) ever registered with the cluster is
>         persistently stored in the image and log files. The list is used in two ways:
>         a) at startup to verify whether all nodes have registered, and to report
>         missing nodes;
>         b) at runtime if a data node registers with a new storage id the
>         name node verifies that no new blocks are reported from that storage,
>         which would prevent us from accidentally connecting data nodes from a
>         different cluster.
>     = The name node should have an option to run in safe mode. Starting with
>         that option would mean it never leaves safe mode.
>         This is useful for testing the cluster.
>     = Data nodes that can not connect to the name node for a long time (configurable)
>         should shut down themselves.

Michel Tourn commented on HADOOP-444:
-------------------------------------

I plan to fix this problem like this:
name the "side-effect output files" after the input Split rather than after the taskid:

/in/myfile
/sideout/myfile+200000-100000

And for the first split at offset zero, drop split info, 
i.e. name the output file as the unqaliified filename :
/sideout/myfile

That way, assuming your InputFormat only creates one split per file(*)
then the input filenames and partitioning is preserved (in a different output directory)

And in the case of speculative execution and failed / reexecuted tasks.
those output files are assigned the same name. 
Only one version of the file will remain in the end.
This solves the duplicate-output issue.

Only full output files are committed to HDFS on close. 
So there are no issues with concurrent writes / partial writes.

One question is what needs to be done to guarantee that the version from the last execution "wins" .
Is it a good idea to force an HDFS-delete of a target output file before opening the new version?

(*) for example inputs compressed with file-level compression, like .gzip. Could also be useful to let the user force a single-split.

Doug Cutting commented on HADOOP-322:
-------------------------------------

This looks good.

One minor nit is that the sleep in the unit test should probably be smaller.  If I change the sleep to 1000ms, then the entire test only takes 37 seconds, 20 seconds longer than the 60 second sleep you have.  I run unit tests a lot and am sensitive to them running slowly.

Also, this should be in a mapred subpackage, since it is mapred-specific stuff.  I'd suggest org.apache.hadoop.mapred.jobcontrol.

Thanks for your patience & persistence!

> In my applications, some jobs depend on the outputs of other jobs. Therefore, job dependency forms a DAG. A job is ready to run if and only if it does not have any dependency or all the jobs it depends are finished successfully. To help schedule and monitor a group of jobs like that, I am thinking of implementing a utility that:
> 	- accept jobs with dependency specification
>       - monitor job status
>       - submit jobs when they are ready
> With such a utility, the application can construct its jobs, specify their dependency and then hand the jobs to the utility class. The utility takes care of the details of job submission.
> I'll post my design skech for comments/suggestion.
> Eventually, I'll submit a patch for the utility.

Sanjay Dahiya commented on HADOOP-239:
--------------------------------------

For format of history file on disk - here is a proposal. 

Since we want the file to be flushed on every write, to survive jobtracker restarts. it makes sense to use a simple record oriented structure in file. Each log statement appends a record in the file. Since there can be multiple jobs running at any time the records can be intermixed in the log file ( unless we use one history file per job ). 
Using one history file per job is also a viable option in which case we can separate log files in different directories for different days and delete old files. 

In both cases following simple file format can be used to log history and parse/display in JSPs. 
<recordType> <key=value> <key=value> .... 

where recordType = {JobInfo, Task, MapAttempt, ReduceTask, ReduceAttempt .... }
and keys will depend on recordType e.g. for JobInfo keys = {jobId, jobName, submitTime, launchTime ... }

e.g. log while job start up may look like 

JobInfo jobId=job_001 jobName=wordCount submitTime=0001
JobInfo jobId=job_001 launchTime=0002
...
JobInfo jobId=job_001 finishTime=0002

We can provide a proxy class JobHistory, which exposes specific methods for logging different log events and takes care for formatting issues at a central place.

You're right.  That code will have to be changed to use 
ObjectWritable.writeObject() and ObjectWritable.readObject(), so that 
the subclass name is written too.

> Currently, the application specifies the types of the input keys and values and the RecordReader checks them for consistency. It would make more sense to have the RecordReader define the types of keys that it will produce. Therefore, I propose that we add two new methods to RecordReader:
> WritableComparable createKey();
> Writable createValue();
> Note that I propose adding them to the RecordReader rather than the InputFormat, so that they can specific to a particular input split.

> In the getMapOutput.jsp, tracker.mapOutputLost is called irrespective of whether the sender of the map output threw an exception or the receiver died (thereby closing the socket causing the jsp to throw an exception). Invoking the method causes the corresponding map task to fail and causes it to be rescheduled but it may be the case that the problem is at the reciever's end. Need to do a better check of where the exception was thrown.

> This is a proposal to improve DFS cluster startup process.
> The data node startup procedures were described and implemented in HADOOP-124.
> I'm trying to extend them to the name node here.
> The main idea is to introduce safe mode, which can be entered manually for administration
> purposes, or automatically when a configurable threshold of active data nodes is breached,
> or at startup when the node stays in safe mode until the minimal limit of active
> nodes is reached.
> This are high level requirements intended to improve the name node and cluster reliability.
>     = The name node safe mode means that the name node is not changing the state of the
>        file system. Meta data is read-only, and block replication / removal is not taking place.
>     = In safe mode the name node accepts data node registrations and
>        processes their block reports.
>     = The name node always starts in safe mode and stays safe until the majority
>         (a configurable parameter: safemode.threshold) of data nodes (or blocks?)
>         is reported.
>     = The name node can also fall into safe mode when the number of non-active
>         (heartbeats stopped coming in) data nodes becomes critical.
>     = The startup "silent period", when the name node is in safe mode and is
>         not issuing any block requests to the data nodes, is initially set to a
>         configurable value safemode.timeout.increment. By the end of the timeout
>         the name node checks the safemode.threshold and decides whether to switch
>         to the normal mode or to stay in safe. If the normal mode criteria is not
>         met, then the silent period is extended by incrementing the safemode timeout.
>     = The name node stays in safe mode not longer than a configurable value of
>         safemode.timeout.max, in which case it logs missing data nodes and shuts
>         itself down.
>     = When the name node switches to normal mode it checks whether all required
>         data nodes have actually registered, based on the list of active data storages
>         from the last session. Then it logs missing nodes, if any, and starts
>         replicating and/or deleting blocks as required.
>     = A historical list of data storages (nodes) ever registered with the cluster is
>         persistently stored in the image and log files. The list is used in two ways:
>         a) at startup to verify whether all nodes have registered, and to report
>         missing nodes;
>         b) at runtime if a data node registers with a new storage id the
>         name node verifies that no new blocks are reported from that storage,
>         which would prevent us from accidentally connecting data nodes from a
>         different cluster.
>     = The name node should have an option to run in safe mode. Starting with
>         that option would mean it never leaves safe mode.
>         This is useful for testing the cluster.
>     = Data nodes that can not connect to the name node for a long time (configurable)
>         should shut down themselves.

> In my applications, some jobs depend on the outputs of other jobs. Therefore, job dependency forms a DAG. A job is ready to run if and only if it does not have any dependency or all the jobs it depends are finished successfully. To help schedule and monitor a group of jobs like that, I am thinking of implementing a utility that:
> 	- accept jobs with dependency specification
>       - monitor job status
>       - submit jobs when they are ready
> With such a utility, the application can construct its jobs, specify their dependency and then hand the jobs to the utility class. The utility takes care of the details of job submission.
> I'll post my design skech for comments/suggestion.
> Eventually, I'll submit a patch for the utility.

> In my applications, some jobs depend on the outputs of other jobs. Therefore, job dependency forms a DAG. A job is ready to run if and only if it does not have any dependency or all the jobs it depends are finished successfully. To help schedule and monitor a group of jobs like that, I am thinking of implementing a utility that:
> 	- accept jobs with dependency specification
>       - monitor job status
>       - submit jobs when they are ready
> With such a utility, the application can construct its jobs, specify their dependency and then hand the jobs to the utility class. The utility takes care of the details of job submission.
> I'll post my design skech for comments/suggestion.
> Eventually, I'll submit a patch for the utility.

> This is a proposal to improve DFS cluster startup process.
> The data node startup procedures were described and implemented in HADOOP-124.
> I'm trying to extend them to the name node here.
> The main idea is to introduce safe mode, which can be entered manually for administration
> purposes, or automatically when a configurable threshold of active data nodes is breached,
> or at startup when the node stays in safe mode until the minimal limit of active
> nodes is reached.
> This are high level requirements intended to improve the name node and cluster reliability.
>     = The name node safe mode means that the name node is not changing the state of the
>        file system. Meta data is read-only, and block replication / removal is not taking place.
>     = In safe mode the name node accepts data node registrations and
>        processes their block reports.
>     = The name node always starts in safe mode and stays safe until the majority
>         (a configurable parameter: safemode.threshold) of data nodes (or blocks?)
>         is reported.
>     = The name node can also fall into safe mode when the number of non-active
>         (heartbeats stopped coming in) data nodes becomes critical.
>     = The startup "silent period", when the name node is in safe mode and is
>         not issuing any block requests to the data nodes, is initially set to a
>         configurable value safemode.timeout.increment. By the end of the timeout
>         the name node checks the safemode.threshold and decides whether to switch
>         to the normal mode or to stay in safe. If the normal mode criteria is not
>         met, then the silent period is extended by incrementing the safemode timeout.
>     = The name node stays in safe mode not longer than a configurable value of
>         safemode.timeout.max, in which case it logs missing data nodes and shuts
>         itself down.
>     = When the name node switches to normal mode it checks whether all required
>         data nodes have actually registered, based on the list of active data storages
>         from the last session. Then it logs missing nodes, if any, and starts
>         replicating and/or deleting blocks as required.
>     = A historical list of data storages (nodes) ever registered with the cluster is
>         persistently stored in the image and log files. The list is used in two ways:
>         a) at startup to verify whether all nodes have registered, and to report
>         missing nodes;
>         b) at runtime if a data node registers with a new storage id the
>         name node verifies that no new blocks are reported from that storage,
>         which would prevent us from accidentally connecting data nodes from a
>         different cluster.
>     = The name node should have an option to run in safe mode. Starting with
>         that option would mean it never leaves safe mode.
>         This is useful for testing the cluster.
>     = Data nodes that can not connect to the name node for a long time (configurable)
>         should shut down themselves.

> In my applications, some jobs depend on the outputs of other jobs. Therefore, job dependency forms a DAG. A job is ready to run if and only if it does not have any dependency or all the jobs it depends are finished successfully. To help schedule and monitor a group of jobs like that, I am thinking of implementing a utility that:
> 	- accept jobs with dependency specification
>       - monitor job status
>       - submit jobs when they are ready
> With such a utility, the application can construct its jobs, specify their dependency and then hand the jobs to the utility class. The utility takes care of the details of job submission.
> I'll post my design skech for comments/suggestion.
> Eventually, I'll submit a patch for the utility.

Sameer Paranjpye commented on HADOOP-439:
-----------------------------------------

This ought to be resolvable by replacing UTF8 by the new Text class. Streaming should use Text instead of UTF8 to represent strings.

> The streaming code internally reads the input data into a UTF8 .  This causes truncated data to be shipped to the mapper when the input exceeds about 21000 characters, with no notice to the user except possibly in individual tasks' machines' logs, which people would not normally read for apparently successful jobs.

> The streaming code internally reads the input data into a UTF8 .  This causes truncated data to be shipped to the mapper when the input exceeds about 21000 characters, with no notice to the user except possibly in individual tasks' machines' logs, which people would not normally read for apparently successful jobs.

Sameer Paranjpye commented on HADOOP-343:
-----------------------------------------

I think this needs further attention. The patch is probably out of date at this point, but the problem is real. I think this may also be responsible for the 'long pause' at the end of the shuffle.

If a tasktracker fails, it's map outputs are lost. However, the other tasktrackers are unaware of this. Towards the end of the shuffle they have all map output locations cached and they keep trying to pull data from the lost tasktracker, one file at a time. Every one of these file transfers fails, each failed transfer also causes the tasktrackers to back off from pulling their remaining outputs. The cumulative effect of all the backoffs is the long pause.

> Overview of the log archiver/analyzer utility...
> 1. Input
>   The tool takes as input a list of directory URLs, each url could also we associated with a file-pattern to specify what pattern of files in that directory are to be used.
>   e.g. http://g1015:50030/logs/hadoop-sameer-jobtracker-*
>          file:///export/crawlspace/sanjay/hadoop/trunk/run/logs/haddop-sanjay-namenode-* (local disk on the machine on which the job was submitted)
> 2. The tool supports 2 main functions:
>   a) Archival
>     Archive the logs in the DFS in the following hierarchy:
>    /users/<username>/log-archive/YYYY/mm/dd/HHMMSS.log by default 
>    Or a user-specified directory and then: 
>    <input-dir>/YYYY/mm/dd/HHMMSS.log
>   b) Processing with simple sort/grep primitives
>     Archive the logs as above and then grep for lines with given pattern (e.g. INFO) and then sort with spec e.g. <logger><level><date>. (Note: This is proposed with current log4j based logging in mind... do we need anything more generic?). The sort/grep specs are user-provided; along with directory URLs.
> 3. Thoughts on implementation...
>   a) Archival
>     Current idea is to put a .jsp page (src/webapps) on each of the nodes; which then does a *copyFromLocal* of the log-file into the DFS. The jobtracker will fire n map-tasks which only hit the jsp page as per the directory URLs. The reduce-task is a no-op and only collects statistics on failures (if any).
>   b) Processing with sort/grep
>     Here, the tool first archives the files as above and then another set of map-reduce tasks will do the sort/grep on the files in DFS with given specs.
>                                                                                           - * - * -

Arun C Murthy updated HADOOP-54:
--------------------------------

    Attachment: SequenceFilesII.patch

Owen, appreciate your time... 

Responses inline:

> 1. The Writer class should have the unneeded compression stuff taken out.
> 3. The sync bytes in the block compressed writer should be written before the block rather than after (except for the first block). The goal is to get them between blocks, you don't really want one at the end (or beginning) of the file.
> 4. The CompressedBytes class should be private.
> 5. The private Writer constructor on line 307 is not used.
> 6. The static field VERSION_4 should be renamed to BLOCK_COMPRESS_VERSION and it should be marked final.
> 8. We really need to move to the Text class instead of UTF8. This has a couple of changes:
  A. in writeFileHeader, the "new UTF8(...).write(out);" should be "Text.writeString(out, ...);"
  B. in init, reading the class names strings is the reverse: keyClass = Text.readString(in);
  C. we have to support the UTF8 string encodings for old file versions, so you'll need to switch behavior based on the version we are reading.

All done and incorporated into latest patch.

> 2. The Writer.compressed and blockCompressed fields should be taken out and replaced with methods.

Not clear - let's discuss this.

> 7. I'd rename the "byte[] version" to "syncBlock" and make a new field "byte version" that will contain just the last byte, which is the file version.

I don't agree about renaming it to 'syncBlock' since it isn't a sync block. I don't mind doing the "byte version" field, but the advantages aren't very clear.

_*_*_

I've attached a new patch (SequenceFilesII.patch) which incorporates Owen's suggestions and also fixes the fallout of the latest SequenceFile in other parts of MR universe.

Also, I've a first cut of the SequenceFile Formats' documentation up:
http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-hadoop/SequenceFile

> SequenceFile will optionally compress individual values.  But both compression and performance would be much better if sequences of keys and values are compressed together.  Sync marks should only be placed between blocks.  This will require some changes to MapFile too, so that all file positions stored there are the positions of blocks, not entries within blocks.  Probably this can be accomplished by adding a getBlockStartPosition() method to SequenceFile.Writer.

Oops...

I've kept this around for this version (deprecated) to ensure existing applications don't break; I plan to get rid of this one hadoop release later.

> SequenceFile will optionally compress individual values.  But both compression and performance would be much better if sequences of keys and values are compressed together.  Sync marks should only be placed between blocks.  This will require some changes to MapFile too, so that all file positions stored there are the positions of blocks, not entries within blocks.  Probably this can be accomplished by adding a getBlockStartPosition() method to SequenceFile.Writer.

Milind Bhandarkar updated HADOOP-421:
-------------------------------------

    Attachment: recordio.patch

Attached patch that replaces String with Text in hadoop-record I/O. Also changes xml-encoding of strings. Earlier it used url encoding to encode and decode strings. Now it uses xml 1.0 compliant character entities.

> Looks like there isn't a java library for bmdiff (I'd love to be corrected on this)... thoughts on how to go about this? A JNI wrapper on top of a C api? If so how difficult does hadoop-dev think it is to implement a input/output stream on top of this? Alternatives?

Arun C Murthy updated HADOOP-441:
---------------------------------

    Description: 
SequenceFiles should support 'custom compressors' which can be specified by the user on creation of the file. 

Readily available packages for gzip and zip (java.util.zip) are among obvious choices to support. Of course there will be hooks so that other compressors can be added in future as long as there is a way to construct (input/output) streams on top of the compressor/decompressor.

The 'classname' of the 'custom compressor/decompressor' could be stored in the header of the SequenceFile which can then be used by SequenceFile.Reader to figure out the appropriate 'decompressor'. Thus I propose we add constructors to SequenceFile.Writer which take in the 'classname' of the compressor's input/output stream classes (e.g. DeflaterOutputStream/InflaterInputStream or GZIPOutputStream/GZIPInputStream), which acts as the hook for future compressors/decompressors.

Thus I propose we add constructors to SequenceFile.Writer which take in the 'classname' of the compressor's input/output stream classes (e.g. DeflaterOutputStream/InflaterInputStream or GZIPOutputStream/GZIPInputStream), which acts as the hook for future compressors/decompressors.

Looks like there isn't a java library for bmdiff (I'd love to be corrected on this)... thoughts on how to go about this? A JNI wrapper on top of a C api? If so how difficult does hadoop-dev think it is to implement a input/output stream on top of this? Alternatives?

> Readily available packages for gzip and zip (java.util.zip) are among obvious choices to support. Of course there will be hooks so that other compressors can be added in future as long as there is a way to construct (input/output) streams on top of the compressor/decompressor.

Unable to create file in dfs in code run on machine not in the cluster.

                 Key: HADOOP-457
                 URL: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-457
             Project: Hadoop
          Issue Type: Bug
          Components: dfs
    Affects Versions: 0.5.0
            Reporter: Johan Oskarson


I've got a tiny hadoop cluster and one machine that's not in the cluster that rsync the latest version off the namenode/jobtracker machine. The machine that's not in the cluster is then responsible for starting a few jobs here and there.

However, the latest trunk is unable to create files in the dfs from my code.
I'm using a simple new OutputStreamWriter(fs.create(file))); and the file creation looks like it's going ok but then this gets thrown:

org.apache.hadoop.ipc.RemoteException: java.io.IOException: failed to create file /user/hadoop/submissions/1150000000/1152000000/1152440000/.1155824015.negsub.crc on client "servernotincluster" because target-length is 0, below MIN_REPLICATION (1)
        at org.apache.hadoop.dfs.FSNamesystem.startFile(FSNamesystem.java:410)
        at org.apache.hadoop.dfs.NameNode.create(NameNode.java:202)

        at org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Server$Handler.run(Server.java:468)

        at org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Client$Connection.run(Client.java:159)


If I add that machine to the conf/slaves it works fine. Note that it's trying to create that file on the server that's not in the cluster.

Hi developers,
i had wrote a mapred job with  OutputKeyClass IntWritable. But the  
keys are not not correct sorted in the output file. I look at the  
code from the Intwritable.Comparator and i am confused.

Currently the compare-method returns:
return thisValue - thatValue;

But what is, if "thisValue" has the value Integer.MIN_VALUE+1 and the  
"thatValue" has the value 2. The result of the method are return  
2147483647. In that case the compare method says that "thisValue" is  
greater than "thatValue".

The method should be return like that:
thisValue < thatValue ? -1 : thisValue == thatValue ? 0 : 1;


Or overlook i something?

Regards,
Marko

Except the '4' is not ASCII '4', but rather the byte 04.

---------------------------------

    Attachment: fuse-hadoop-0.1.0_fuse-j.2.2.3_hadoop.0.5.0.tar.gz

I changed the code for fuse-hadoop. This is a working version for mounting DFS to linux file system. This version works fine with FUSE-J.2.2.3 and HADOOP.0.5.0

Doug Cutting commented on HADOOP-441:
-------------------------------------

The constructors should probably take class instances rather than class names.  Codecs should be based on DeflaterOutputStream and InflaterInputStream, but it would be best to write just one name to the file.  So we might add a compressor factory interface like:

public interface CompressionCodec extends Configurable {
  DeflaterOutputStream createDeflaterOutputStream(OutputStream out);
  InflaterInputStream createInflaterInputStream(InputStream in);
}

Then the constructors would take an instance of this interface and write the name of that class into the file.  Implementations would be required to provide a public default constructor.

We might also add methods like the following to this interface:

  void writeVersion(DataOutputStream out);
  void readVersion(DataInputStream in) throws VersionMismatchException;

That would permit folks to safely revise a codec without having to use a new class name.

> SequenceFiles should support 'custom compressors' which can be specified by the user on creation of the file. 
> Readily available packages for gzip and zip (java.util.zip) are among obvious choices to support. Of course there will be hooks so that other compressors can be added in future as long as there is a way to construct (input/output) streams on top of the compressor/decompressor.
> The 'classname' of the 'custom compressor/decompressor' could be stored in the header of the SequenceFile which can then be used by SequenceFile.Reader to figure out the appropriate 'decompressor'. Thus I propose we add constructors to SequenceFile.Writer which take in the 'classname' of the compressor's input/output stream classes (e.g. DeflaterOutputStream/InflaterInputStream or GZIPOutputStream/GZIPInputStream), which acts as the hook for future compressors/decompressors.

Unless or until we put authentication in-place in the webAPI, I think  
we need to be very careful about adding admin function to it.

We have clusters with an increasing number of users who are not  
cluster admins on them.  We don't want to enable them to reconfig the  
system.  We do want to allow them to use the web UIs to diagnose the  
status of their jobs and files.

In our other large clustered applications, we've found that  
segregating a web interrogation UI from a file based (or other  
control port) based admin UI avoids a lot of pain and allows  
administrative flexibility.

Doug Cutting commented on HADOOP-54:
------------------------------------

I am not convinced we want folks to encourage folks to add new SequenceFile.Writer subclasses.  Thus we should change the (new) protected fields to package private.  This will also simplify the javadoc.  I'd also prefer that these subclasses were not public either, making everyone use the factory.  This would expose far less of the implementation and further simplify the javadoc.  Owen has disputed this earlier.  Owen?

I note that when you updated uses of SequenceFile.Writer you consistently used the factory in favor of explicitly constructing the subclasses.  Thanks!  That makes hiding the subclasses easy.  We can always make them public later, if needed, but, once they're public, it is hard to remove them.  If we think the factory method has too many confusing parameters, then we could use a typesafe enumeration, e.g. something like:

writer = SequenceFile.createWriter(fs, conf, path, Compress.BLOCK);

> SequenceFile will optionally compress individual values.  But both compression and performance would be much better if sequences of keys and values are compressed together.  Sync marks should only be placed between blocks.  This will require some changes to MapFile too, so that all file positions stored there are the positions of blocks, not entries within blocks.  Probably this can be accomplished by adding a getBlockStartPosition() method to SequenceFile.Writer.

Sameer Paranjpye commented on HADOOP-54:
----------------------------------------

+1 on using an enumeration to represent the compression method. It's not necessary but makes code much more readable.

> SequenceFile will optionally compress individual values.  But both compression and performance would be much better if sequences of keys and values are compressed together.  Sync marks should only be placed between blocks.  This will require some changes to MapFile too, so that all file positions stored there are the positions of blocks, not entries within blocks.  Probably this can be accomplished by adding a getBlockStartPosition() method to SequenceFile.Writer.

Doug Cutting commented on HADOOP-4:
-----------------------------------

I'd like to be able to commit this to the contrib tree, but it could use a bit more polish.  Unfortunately we cannot commit the fuse-j jar file, since it is released under the LGPL.  What would be great is a build.xml that downloaded and built fuse-j.

The README could also include more info on installing fuse.

On Ubuntu I was able to do this with:

sudo apt-get install fuse-utils libfuse2 libfuse-devel

If you've never built things on your Ubuntu box then you might also need:

sudo apt-get install make gcc libc6-dev

---------------------------------

    Attachment: fuse-hadoop-0.1.0_fuse-j.2.4_hadoop.0.5.0.tar.gz

I changed the code for fuse-hadoop. This is a working version for mounting
DFS to linux file system. This version works fine with FUSE-J.2.4 and
HADOOP.0.5.0

Enjoy

Devaraj Das updated HADOOP-312:
-------------------------------

    Attachment: no_conn_caching.patch

Increasing the accept queue length and a simple retry mechanism helped very much. Two cases - (1) where idle connections are cached for a max of 1 sec at the client, and (2) where connections are fully cached.
The performance of the sort benchmark (total time it takes to complete the run) is, most of the times, better with (1). But with a few tasks failing here and there (in both cases), it's actually hard to conclusively say anything about performance in terms of the time it takes to run the benchmark. Made the accept queue length configurable (since that can be manually set on Linux systems as part of the configurable TCP/IP parameters) with the default being 128.

> Servers and clients (client include datanodes, tasktrackers, DFSClients & tasks) should not cache connections or maybe cache them for very short periods of time. Clients should set up & tear down connections to the servers everytime they need to contact the servers (including the heartbeats). If connection is cached, then reuse the existing connection for a few subsequent transactions until the connection expires. The heartbeat interval should be more so that many more clients (order of  tens of thousands) can be accomodated within 1 heartbeat interval.

---------------------------------------

This must've been caused by some unrelated problem.
A clean install doesn't produce this problem.

Sorry for any inconvenience caused by this bug report.

Arun C Murthy updated HADOOP-54:
--------------------------------

    Attachment: SequenceFile.updated.final.patch

Doug - here's the latest patch.

It incorporates all your comments (remove protected, type-safe enum and non-public subclasses). I agree we can make the subclasses 'public' at a later date if need be, hence I've made them package private.

> SequenceFile will optionally compress individual values.  But both compression and performance would be much better if sequences of keys and values are compressed together.  Sync marks should only be placed between blocks.  This will require some changes to MapFile too, so that all file positions stored there are the positions of blocks, not entries within blocks.  Probably this can be accomplished by adding a getBlockStartPosition() method to SequenceFile.Writer.

Vetle Roeim commented on HADOOP-260:
------------------------------------

As far as I can tell, it's still necessary to define a separate PID directory for this to work; the PID variable in hadoop-deamon.sh does not take the configuration directory into account. While having a separate PID directory per configuration is not a problem per se, it seems unnecessary.

Sanjay Dahiya updated HADOOP-263:
---------------------------------

    Attachment: patch.txt

Thanks Owen for the review, here is an updated patch. 

The earlier patch failed with latest trunk due to some changes in TaskInProgress, so I redid some part of it. Attached patch works with the latest trunk.

Doug Cutting updated HADOOP-54:
-------------------------------

    Status: Open  (was: Patch Available)

I think this is nearly ready.

A minor improvement: the typesafe enumeration instances should probably have a toString() method, to facilitate debugging.

Running the TestSequenceFile unit test caused my 515MB Ubuntu box to swap horribly and it didn't complete.  I grabbed a stack trace and saw:

    [junit]     at java.util.zip.Inflater.init(Native Method)
    [junit]     at java.util.zip.Inflater.<init>(Inflater.java:75)

    [junit]     at org.apache.hadoop.io.SequenceFile$Reader.createValueBytes(SequenceFile.java:1195)
    [junit]     at org.apache.hadoop.io.SequenceFile$Sorter$SortPass.run(SequenceFile.java:1459)
    [junit]     at org.apache.hadoop.io.SequenceFile$Sorter.sortPass(SequenceFile.java:1413)
    [junit]     at org.apache.hadoop.io.SequenceFile$Sorter.sort(SequenceFile.java:1386)
    [junit]     at org.apache.hadoop.io.SequenceFile$Sorter.sort(SequenceFile.java:1406)
    [junit]     at org.apache.hadoop.io.TestSequenceFile.sortTest(TestSequenceFile.java:178)

Since sorting should not do any inflating, the Inflater should probably not be created in this case.  So maybe we should lazily initialize this field?

More generally, before we commit this we should ensure that performance is comparable to what it was before.  Creating a new ValueBytes wrapper per entry processed when sorting looks expensive to me, but this may in fact be insignificant.  If it is significant, then we might replace the ValueBytes API with a compressor API, where the bytes to be compressed are passed explicitly.

> SequenceFile will optionally compress individual values.  But both compression and performance would be much better if sequences of keys and values are compressed together.  Sync marks should only be placed between blocks.  This will require some changes to MapFile too, so that all file positions stored there are the positions of blocks, not entries within blocks.  Probably this can be accomplished by adding a getBlockStartPosition() method to SequenceFile.Writer.

Doug Cutting updated HADOOP-312:
--------------------------------

    Status: Open  (was: Patch Available)

When connecting, we should first create an unconnected socket, then attempt to connect with an explicit timeout, and retry the connect if it fails.  Otherwise the retries are subject to whaterver the default timeout is.  Since, with this patch, we're connecting much more, the connect timeout is more significant and should not be left to the system default.

> Servers and clients (client include datanodes, tasktrackers, DFSClients & tasks) should not cache connections or maybe cache them for very short periods of time. Clients should set up & tear down connections to the servers everytime they need to contact the servers (including the heartbeats). If connection is cached, then reuse the existing connection for a few subsequent transactions until the connection expires. The heartbeat interval should be more so that many more clients (order of  tens of thousands) can be accomodated within 1 heartbeat interval.

All the DFSShell commands do not check for the number of arguments. In DFSShell.run(), the args length is not checked before calling copyfromlocal, movefromlocal, copytolocal, and some others as well. This throws out arrrayoutofbounds exception in case lesser number of arguments is specified.

variable expansion in Configuration
-----------------------------------

                 Key: HADOOP-463
                 URL: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-463
             Project: Hadoop
          Issue Type: Improvement
          Components: conf
            Reporter: Michel Tourn


Add variable expansion to Configuration class.
=================

This is necessary for shared, client-side configurations:

A Job submitter (an HDFS client) requires:
<name>dfs.data.dir</name><value>/tmp/${user.name}/dfs</value>

A local-mode mapreduce requires:
<name>mapred.temp.dir</name><value>/tmp/${user.name}/mapred/tmp</value>

Why this is necessary :
=================

Currently we use shared directories like:
<name>dfs.data.dir</name><value>/tmp/dfs</value>
This superficially seems to work.
After all, different JVM clients create their own private subdirectory map_xxxx., so they will not conflict.

What really happens:

1. /tmp/ is world-writable, as it's supposed to.
2. Hadoop will create missing subdirectories. 
This is Java so that for ex. /tmp/system is created as writable only by the JVM process user
3. This is a shared client machine so next user's JVM will find /tmp/system owned by somebody else. Creating a directory within /tmp/system fails

Implementation of var expansion
=============
in class Configuration, 
The Properties really store things like put("banner", "hello ${user.name}");
In public String get(String name): postprocess the returned value:
Use a regexp to find the pattern ${xxxx}
Lookup xxxx as a system property
If found, replace ${xxxx} by the system property value.
Else leave as-is. An unexpanded ${xxxx} is a hint that the variable name is invalid.


Other workarounds 
===============
The other proposed workarounds are not as elegant as variable expansion.

Workaround 1: 
have an installation script which does:
mkdir /tmp/dfs
chmod uga+rw /tmp/dfs
repeat for ALL configured subdirectories at ANY nesting level
keep the script in sync with changes to hadoop properties.
support on non-Unix platform
Make sure the installtion script runs before Hadoop runs for the first time.
If users change the permissions/delete any of the shared directories, it breaks again.

Workaround 2: 
do the chmod operations from within the Hadoop code.
In pure java 1.4, 1.5 this is not possible.
It requires the Hadoop client process to have chmod privilege (rather than just mkdir privilege)
It requires to special-case directory creation code.

<name>dfs.data.dir</name><value>/tmp/${user.name}/dfs</value>

A local-mode mapreduce requires:
<name>mapred.temp.dir</name><value>/tmp/${user.name}/mapred/tmp</value>

Why this is necessary :
=================

Currently we use shared directories like:
<name>dfs.data.dir</name><value>/tmp/dfs</value>
This superficially seems to work.
After all, different JVM clients create their own private subdirectory map_xxxx., so they will not conflict.

What really happens:

1. /tmp/ is world-writable, as it's supposed to.
2. Hadoop will create missing subdirectories. 
This is Java so that for ex. /tmp/system is created as writable only by the JVM process user
3. This is a shared client machine so next user's JVM will find /tmp/system owned by somebody else. Creating a directory within /tmp/system fails

Implementation of var expansion
=============
in class Configuration, 
The Properties really store things like put("banner", "hello ${user.name}");
In public String get(String name): postprocess the returned value:
Use a regexp to find the pattern ${xxxx}
Lookup xxxx as a system property
If found, replace ${xxxx} by the system property value.
Else leave as-is. An unexpanded ${xxxx} is a hint that the variable name is invalid.


Other workarounds 
===============
The other proposed workarounds are not as elegant as variable expansion.

Workaround 1: 
have an installation script which does:
mkdir /tmp/dfs
chmod uga+rw /tmp/dfs
repeat for ALL configured subdirectories at ANY nesting level
keep the script in sync with changes to hadoop properties.
support on non-Unix platform
Make sure the installtion script runs before Hadoop runs for the first time.
If users change the permissions/delete any of the shared directories, it breaks again.

Workaround 2: 
do the chmod operations from within the Hadoop code.
In pure java 1.4, 1.5 this is not possible.
It requires the Hadoop client process to have chmod privilege (rather than just mkdir privilege)
It requires to special-case directory creation code.

Kimoon Kim commented on HADOOP-428:
-----------------------------------

Found a 2005 paper where the authors modified condor_startd so that node ClassAd includes the list of SRM input files available on an execute node. (see http://sdm.lbl.gov/~arie/papers/CoScheduling.SSDBM05.pdf)  This allows a task to be scheduled to a node that has an input file, similar to how a map task of hadoop gets scheduled. Authors claim the modification of condor_startd was not so hard to them. Key optimization was not to import all files, but to only import files for current job(s) so that Condor matchmaking avoids scale barrier.

> The issue is about using/enhancing Condor's features for Hadoop's Map Reduce framework. Some of the early thoughts in this respect:
> * One should be able to submit a MR job that takes advantage of Condor's features like node reservation according to a job's requirements, monitoring of jobs, etc.
> * JobTracker and TaskTrackers work as Master/Workers in the Condor environment. One should be able to simply start a MR cluster and the cluster goes down when the job is done.
> * The classads can have an attribute for input file block locations that will be an input to Condor's scheduling decisions.
> * Condor's features of monitoring jobs can be leveraged to reschedule failed TaskTrackers. Checkpointing of JobTrackers can also probably be done so that if the JobTracker job dies for some reason, the failed jobs can be restarted to start from the point where the JobTracker was last checkpointed at (assuming the input data has not changed).
> * User priorities, job priorities should also be handled. If nodes are currently in use due to a job being run by one user, and another user of the same priority submits a new job, it gets queued and opportunistically the job of the second user is scheduled - for e.g., one master and 1 worker to start with and then 2 workers and so on... If the second user is of a higher priority, then the first user's job is completely suspended.

Troubleshooting message for RunJar (bin/hadoop jar)
---------------------------------------------------

                 Key: HADOOP-464
                 URL: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-464

          Issue Type: Improvement
          Components: util
            Reporter: Michel Tourn
         Attachments: runjar.patch

Many users get this exception when using bin/hadoop
There are various reasons:
HADOOP_CONF_DIR or HADOOP_HOME misconfigured. 
"hadoop jar" parameter incorrect

So the patch displays the path of the jar it is trying to open if this fails: 

Problem while opening hadoop job jar: /home/build/hadoop-streaming.jar
Exception in thread "main" java.util.zip.ZipException: error in opening zip file
        at java.util.zip.ZipFile.open(Native Method)

Kimoon Kim commented on HADOOP-331:
-----------------------------------

Instead of one output, what about n outputs, where 1 <= n < # reducers? n can be configurable and is set to a number that can avoid FS thrashing. Each output file contains a disjoint set of partitions so that reducer in need of a partition will later access only one file. Increased locality.

Given we are thinking of sorting map outputs,  this also allows us to avoid global sorting. i.e. sorting happens on one output file at a time that has only small set of data.

> The current strategy of writing a file per target map is consuming a lot of unused buffer space (causing out of memory crashes) and puts a lot of burden on the FS (many opens, inodes used, etc).  
> I propose that we write a single file containing all output and also write an index file IDing which byte range in the file goes to each reduce.  This will remove the issue of buffer waste, address scaling issues with number of open files and generally set us up better for scaling.  It will also have advantages with very small inputs, since the buffer cache will reduce the number of seeks needed and the data serving node can open a single file and just keep it open rather than needing to do directory and open ops on every request.
> The only issue I see is that in cases where the task output is substantiallyu larger than its input, we may need to spill multiple times.  In this case, we can do a merge after all spills are complete (or during the final spill).

Jobtracker doesn't always spread reduce tasks evenly if (mapred.tasktracker.tasks.maximum > 1)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                 Key: HADOOP-465
                 URL: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-465
             Project: Hadoop
          Issue Type: Bug
          Components: mapred
            Reporter: Chris Schneider
            Priority: Minor


I note that (at least for Nutch 0.8 Generator.Selector.reduce) if mapred.reduce.tasks is the same as the number of tasktrackers, and mapred.tasktracker.tasks.maximum is left at the default of 2, I typically have no reduce tasks running on a few of my tasktrackers, and two reduce tasks running on the same number of other tasktrackers.

It seems like the jobtracker should assign reduce tasks to tasktrackers in a round robin fashion, so that the distribution will be spread as evenly as possible. The current implementation would seem to waste at least some time if one or more slave machines have to execute two reduce tasks simultaneously while other tasktrackers sit idle, with the amount of wasted time depending on how dependent the reduce tasks were on the slave machine's resources.

I first thought that perhaps the jobtracker was "overloading" the tasktrackers that had already finished their map tasks (and avoiding those that were still mapping). However, as I understand it, the reduce tasks are all launched at the beginning of the job so that they are all ready and waiting for map output data when it first appears.

> Servers and clients (client include datanodes, tasktrackers, DFSClients & tasks) should not cache connections or maybe cache them for very short periods of time. Clients should set up & tear down connections to the servers everytime they need to contact the servers (including the heartbeats). If connection is cached, then reuse the existing connection for a few subsequent transactions until the connection expires. The heartbeat interval should be more so that many more clients (order of  tens of thousands) can be accomodated within 1 heartbeat interval.

Startup scripts will not start instances of Hadoop daemons w/different configs w/o setting separate PID directories
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                 Key: HADOOP-466
                 URL: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-466
             Project: Hadoop
          Issue Type: Improvement
    Affects Versions: 0.5.0
            Reporter: Vetle Roeim


Configuration directories can be specified by either setting HADOOP_CONF_DIR or using the --config command line option. However, the hadoop-daemon.sh script will not start the daemons unless the PID directory is separate for each configuration.

The issue is that the code for generating PID filenames is not dependent on the configuration directory. While the PID directory can be changed in hadoop-env.sh, it seems a little unnecessary to have this restriction.

Vetle Roeim updated HADOOP-466:
-------------------------------

    Attachment: hadoop-466.diff

This patch generates a md5 hash from the HADOOP_CONF_DIR variable, and uses that in the PID filename.

This will fix this issue, allowing daemons to be started with separate configurations, without having to create and configure separate directories for PID files.

Broken on java-1.4
and a bug in static method getTestString(int len).
This function generates a character with code point equal or smaller then 0xFFFF, and converts this into array of chars of size 2(which should be one) and appened it buffer.
So resulting into a a null character tobe inserted into string after a no null character.

It is not possible to set the scheduling priority in the Hadoop configuration. Attached is a patch for starting the Hadoop daemons through nice with the configured priority (can be configured in conf/hadoop-env.sh, for instance).

I would have included a patch for conf/hadoop-env.sh as well, but it seems to be ignored?

Portability of hadoop shell scripts for deployment
--------------------------------------------------

                 Key: HADOOP-469
                 URL: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-469
             Project: Hadoop
          Issue Type: Bug
    Affects Versions: 0.5.0
            Reporter: Jean-Baptiste Quenot
         Attachments: 20060821-hadoop-bin

Hadoop shell scripts are based on /bin/bash, which is a "standard" shell only on GNU/Linux. On other Unix systems like FreeBSD however the "standard" shell is /bin/sh. The attached patch addresses these compatiblity issues.

> SequenceFile will optionally compress individual values.  But both compression and performance would be much better if sequences of keys and values are compressed together.  Sync marks should only be placed between blocks.  This will require some changes to MapFile too, so that all file positions stored there are the positions of blocks, not entries within blocks.  Probably this can be accomplished by adding a getBlockStartPosition() method to SequenceFile.Writer.

Owen supplied an example of how to write mappers and reducers in Python 
using Jython.

http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/lucene/hadoop/trunk/src/examples/python/

A similar example in Ruby, using JRuby, would be cool to have.

Arun C Murthy updated HADOOP-54:
--------------------------------

    Attachment: SequenceFile.20060821.perfomance.txt

Doug - here's another patch incorporating the fix (lazy initialization of the inflater) plus your other suggestions.

I've also attached results of a quick test run of SequenceFile-v3 v/s SequenceFile-v4 (2 runs of 10k and 100k records respectively). Within that framework it seems reasonable to assume that creating one ValueBytes object per-record doesn't show  up blatantly (of course we can further iterate on this); IAC there is a safety net for extreme corner cases (http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-54#action_12425953).

PS: The existing TestSequenceFile.java in trunk doesn't pass along the 'compress' flag to mergeTest - I ran the tests after fixing it; the patch reflects that too. Just fyi.

As I don't have Hadoop installed (yet), I'm not able to offer a test
case, but I'm fairly confident of a bug line TextInputFormat.

The current implementation will ignore the first line of a file split
when the previous split ended with a newline.

There are two ways to fix this, the easiest (and most efficient) is for
the preceding split to always read up to the first newline in the
succeeding split.

Changing:

http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/lucene/hadoop/trunk/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/mapred/TextInputFormat.java?view=markup

public class TextInputFormat extends InputFormatBase {
...
    return new RecordReader() {
...
        /** Read a line. */
        public synchronized boolean next(Writable key, Writable value)
          throws IOException {
          long pos = in.getPos();
          if (pos >= end)
            return false;

to:

          if (pos > end)
            return false;

will do the trick.

> SequenceFile will optionally compress individual values.  But both compression and performance would be much better if sequences of keys and values are compressed together.  Sync marks should only be placed between blocks.  This will require some changes to MapFile too, so that all file positions stored there are the positions of blocks, not entries within blocks.  Probably this can be accomplished by adding a getBlockStartPosition() method to SequenceFile.Writer.

Owen O'Malley commented on HADOOP-372:
--------------------------------------

HADOOP-450 certainly made this easier, but it doesn't really solve the problem. However, I think that with an implementation of HADOOP-451 (abstract input splits), we could do this all in library code. Something along the lines of:

public class MultiInputPath {
  /* must be called after the InputFormat and MapRunner have been set in the JobConf */
  public static void addHooks(JobConf conf);

  /* add a new input directory and the relevant input format and mapper classes */
  public static void addInputPath(conf, Path inputDirectory, Class InputFormat, Class Mapper);
}

The MultiInputPath will wrap the user's InputFormat, InputSplit, and MapRunner. In particular, the InputSplit will contain the user's InputSplit as well as the InputFormat and Mapper classes.  

This will pull all of the specialized code into a library instead of the framework, which is a big win.

Thoughts?

Doug Cutting commented on HADOOP-461:
-------------------------------------

Java 1.4 compatibility is not currently a priority for Hadoop.

Is there a platform you require where Java 1.5 is not available?

Doug Cutting resolved HADOOP-464.
---------------------------------

    Fix Version/s: 0.6.0
       Resolution: Fixed

I committed this, although implemented slightly differently.  Rather than printing a message to standard error to amend the uninformative exception, I instead improved the exception.  Now the output looks like:

% bin/hadoop jar foo
Exception in thread "main" java.io.IOException: Error opening job jar: foo
        at org.apache.hadoop.util.RunJar.main(RunJar.java:82)

Doug Cutting commented on HADOOP-312:
-------------------------------------

Several of the logging statements look like:

  if (LOG.isDebugEnabled())
    LOG.info(getName() + ...);

But you should log and check the same level. So these should instead be:

  if (LOG.isDebugEnabled())
    LOG.debug(getName() + ...);

Also, when connecting, you catch Exception, then check exception types with 'instanceof'.  It would be better to catch those particular exceptions.  You're currently silently trapping other exceptions too.

> Servers and clients (client include datanodes, tasktrackers, DFSClients & tasks) should not cache connections or maybe cache them for very short periods of time. Clients should set up & tear down connections to the servers everytime they need to contact the servers (including the heartbeats). If connection is cached, then reuse the existing connection for a few subsequent transactions until the connection expires. The heartbeat interval should be more so that many more clients (order of  tens of thousands) can be accomodated within 1 heartbeat interval.

> Configuration directories can be specified by either setting HADOOP_CONF_DIR or using the --config command line option. However, the hadoop-daemon.sh script will not start the daemons unless the PID directory is separate for each configuration.
> The issue is that the code for generating PID filenames is not dependent on the configuration directory. While the PID directory can be changed in hadoop-env.sh, it seems a little unnecessary to have this restriction.

Doug Cutting commented on HADOOP-468:
-------------------------------------

I think this would be a useful feature to have.

Two nits with the patch: I think it will be easier to maintain if we set HADOOP_NICE_VALUE to zero by default and then only have a single invocation of bin/hadoop in the script, now with 'nice'.  Since that command line is rather central and likely to be further changed, it's better to not have it replicated.  Also we should document the new environment variable in the file header.

> It is not possible to set the scheduling priority in the Hadoop configuration. Attached is a patch for starting the Hadoop daemons through nice with the configured priority (can be configured in conf/hadoop-env.sh, for instance).
> I would have included a patch for conf/hadoop-env.sh as well, but it seems to be ignored?

> Hadoop shell scripts are based on /bin/bash, which is a "standard" shell only on GNU/Linux. On other Unix systems like FreeBSD however the "standard" shell is /bin/sh. The attached patch addresses these compatiblity issues.

Runping Qi commented on HADOOP-372:
-----------------------------------


The patch for Hadoop-450 laid the foundation for this issue. But the specific aspects of this issue are yet to be addressed, and I started to work on a patch for it. The patch is to:
        * allow the user to specify different input format classes for different input directories
        * allow the user to specify different mapper classes for different key/value class pair.

My thought is to extend the JobConf class with the following methods:

        public void setInputFormatClass(Class theInputFormatClass, Path p) 

for specifying different input format classes
for specifying different mapper classes.

The FileSplit class should be extended to have a method:
         public Class getInputFormatClass() 

The initTasks method of JobInProgress should make due changes to create file FileSplit objects with the correct input format class information. 
        

For supporting different mapper classes, we can expend the JobConf class:

        public void setMapperClass(Class theMapperClass,  Class theKeyClass, Class theValueClass) 
        public Class getMapperClass(Class theKeyClass, Class theValueClass) 

The idea is that, for each split, we know the input format class, from there, we know the corresponding record reader, then we know the key/value classes of the input records.

Another possibility is to allow the user to specify a mapper class per input path, in the same way as for the input format class. To do that, the FileSplit class needs to support the following method:
        public Class getMapperClass()

Thoughts?

> Right now, the user can specify multiple input directories for a map reduce job. 
> However, the files under all the directories are assumed to be in the same format, 
> with the same key/value classes. This proves to be  a serious limit in many situations. 
> Here is an example. Suppose I have three simple tables: 
> one has URLs and their rank values (page ranks), 
> another has URLs and their classification values, 
> and the third one has the URL meta data such as crawl status, last crawl time, etc. 
> Suppose now I need a job to generate a list of URLs to be crawled next. 
> The decision depends on the info in all the three tables.
> Right now, there is no easy way to accomplish this.
> However, this job can be done if the framework allows to specify different inputformats for different input dirs.
> Suppose my three tables are in the following directory respectively: rankTable, classificationTable. and metaDataTable. 
> If we extend JobConf class with the following method (as Owen suggested to me):
>     addInputPath(aPath, anInputFormatClass, anInputKeyClass, anInputValueClass)
> Then I can specify my job as follows:
>     addInputPath(rankTable, SequenceFileInputFormat.class, UTF8.class, DoubleWritable.class)
>     addInputPath(classificationTable, TextInputFormat.class, UTF8,class, UTF8.class)
>     addInputPath(metaDataTable, SequenceFileInputFormat.class, UTF8.class, MyRecord.class)
> If an input directory is added through the current API, it will have the same meaning as it is now. 
> Thus this extension will not affect any applications that do not need this new feature.
> It is relatively easy for the M/R framework to create an appropriate record reader for a map task based on the above information.
> And that is the only change needed for supporting this extension.

> SequenceFile will optionally compress individual values.  But both compression and performance would be much better if sequences of keys and values are compressed together.  Sync marks should only be placed between blocks.  This will require some changes to MapFile too, so that all file positions stored there are the positions of blocks, not entries within blocks.  Probably this can be accomplished by adding a getBlockStartPosition() method to SequenceFile.Writer.

Yoram Arnon commented on HADOOP-466:
------------------------------------

perhaps HADOOP_IDENT_STRING is not required any more, or is indeed harmful.
Having it enables running multiple instances on the same conf dir by running as different users.
it may be ok for log/out files, to separate output from different runs, but for pid files it's better to use the md5 without the string

> Configuration directories can be specified by either setting HADOOP_CONF_DIR or using the --config command line option. However, the hadoop-daemon.sh script will not start the daemons unless the PID directory is separate for each configuration.
> The issue is that the code for generating PID filenames is not dependent on the configuration directory. While the PID directory can be changed in hadoop-env.sh, it seems a little unnecessary to have this restriction.

Owen O'Malley commented on HADOOP-372:
--------------------------------------

I really think this should be done outside of the framework without adding 4 new fairly complicated public methods into the JobConf.

I also don't like using types to distinguish which Mapper to use. A typical case will be two directories using TextInputFormats where you want to apply separate Mappers to pull out different fields. I think it is much nicer to define the entire pipeline, rather than using types to infer it.

InputSplit (from an input directory) -> RecordReader (via InputFormat) -> Mapper

> Right now, the user can specify multiple input directories for a map reduce job. 
> However, the files under all the directories are assumed to be in the same format, 
> with the same key/value classes. This proves to be  a serious limit in many situations. 
> Here is an example. Suppose I have three simple tables: 
> one has URLs and their rank values (page ranks), 
> another has URLs and their classification values, 
> and the third one has the URL meta data such as crawl status, last crawl time, etc. 
> Suppose now I need a job to generate a list of URLs to be crawled next. 
> The decision depends on the info in all the three tables.
> Right now, there is no easy way to accomplish this.
> However, this job can be done if the framework allows to specify different inputformats for different input dirs.
> Suppose my three tables are in the following directory respectively: rankTable, classificationTable. and metaDataTable. 
> If we extend JobConf class with the following method (as Owen suggested to me):
>     addInputPath(aPath, anInputFormatClass, anInputKeyClass, anInputValueClass)
> Then I can specify my job as follows:
>     addInputPath(rankTable, SequenceFileInputFormat.class, UTF8.class, DoubleWritable.class)
>     addInputPath(classificationTable, TextInputFormat.class, UTF8,class, UTF8.class)
>     addInputPath(metaDataTable, SequenceFileInputFormat.class, UTF8.class, MyRecord.class)
> If an input directory is added through the current API, it will have the same meaning as it is now. 
> Thus this extension will not affect any applications that do not need this new feature.
> It is relatively easy for the M/R framework to create an appropriate record reader for a map task based on the above information.
> And that is the only change needed for supporting this extension.

Subject: URL convention for commands / config?

Hi Folks,

Seems like we are adding more and more options and commands that take  
a file or URL argument, where the file can be one of a number of  
places.  Perhaps we can unify things a bit by agreeing to use URL  
conventions in these places?

Where:

file:// is a file on the current machine
http is supported everywhere
hdfs://host[:port]/ is the used to refer to HDFS files
hdfs:/// is used to use the default hdfs?
rsync, ftp and https are supported too (eventually)
torrent:// is used to support bittorent someday...

Should we standardize on such a conventions and start digging to put  
a class together to make this all seamless?

Owen O'Malley commented on HADOOP-465:
--------------------------------------

There was a bug in the Hadoop scheduler that would schedule too many tasks on a node when the cluster was not full.  I fixed that in Hadoop-400, which has been committed after 0.5.0 was cut.

Another thing to keep in mind is that after the tasks are started, they can't be moved. So it is common to see the case where your last four (or 6 or 8) reduces are likely to be running on 2 (or 3 or 4) nodes (assuming 2 tasks/node).

> I note that (at least for Nutch 0.8 Generator.Selector.reduce) if mapred.reduce.tasks is the same as the number of tasktrackers, and mapred.tasktracker.tasks.maximum is left at the default of 2, I typically have no reduce tasks running on a few of my tasktrackers, and two reduce tasks running on the same number of other tasktrackers.
> It seems like the jobtracker should assign reduce tasks to tasktrackers in a round robin fashion, so that the distribution will be spread as evenly as possible. The current implementation would seem to waste at least some time if one or more slave machines have to execute two reduce tasks simultaneously while other tasktrackers sit idle, with the amount of wasted time depending on how dependent the reduce tasks were on the slave machine's resources.
> I first thought that perhaps the jobtracker was "overloading" the tasktrackers that had already finished their map tasks (and avoiding those that were still mapping). However, as I understand it, the reduce tasks are all launched at the beginning of the job so that they are all ready and waiting for map output data when it first appears.

Wouldn't we end up with another java.net.URL in disguise? java.net.URL 
already supports pluggable protocols, we could create one for hdfs ...

FYI, we already use java.net.URI for HDFS in CopyFiles.

Owen O'Malley commented on HADOOP-372:
--------------------------------------

Ok, let me modify this a bit. How about if we define a new class that defines a map input processing pipeline. Each pipeline is given the input directory and the JobConf when it is created and then gets to pick the appropriate InputFormat and Mapper classes.

public class InputPipeline {
  public InputPipeline(Path inputDir, JobConf conf);
  public Class createInputFormat();
  public Class getMapper();
  public int getRequestedNumMaps();
}

The JobConf then picks up 2 methods:

JobConf:
   public void setInputPipelineClass(Class cls);
   public Class getInputPipelineClass();

The default will be InputPipeline that just uses the values from the JobConf for all paths.

The framework changes are pretty light. Just creating the InputPipeline when iterating through the input directories and using that to create the splits. We need to add the InputFormat and Mapper classes to the MapTask and make MapTask.localizeConfiguration set the Mapper class. 

To complete the picture, I'd also add a class in org.apache.hadoop.mapred.lib that looks like:

public class MultiInputPipeline extends InputPipeline {
  public static void addInputPipeline(JobConf conf, Path inputDir, Class inputFormat, Class mapper, int numMaps);
  ...
}

That makes this look like the other hooks that are currently in Hadoop and provides the flexibility that the users need.

I'm all for not reinventing the wheel.  This is probably the right  
implementation direction.

I mainly wanted to get to agreement that we would start taking URIs  
instead of HDFS paths in most API/UIs and generalize this behavior.

             Project: Hadoop

          Components: dfs
            Reporter: Devaraj Das
            Priority: Minor


Some improvement requests from Yoram:

1. directory browsing: the size, replication and block size fields are unused, and indeed the replication field contains random junk. It would be useful to use these fields to represent the size of the folder (recursive, like du -s), and possibly the number of files in the folder.

2. since file sizes are typically very large, introducing a comma thousands separator will make them more readable. 

3. For a particular file I have the list of blocks that make it up. It would be useful to see the block placement information - which datanodes are holding that block. That's arguably more relevant than the block contents when clicking on the block.

4. a nit - 2048 may be too small a chunk size by default. The overhead of getting the first byte is so high (redirect, connect, handshake etc.) that you may as well get 10-20k as your first shot.

JobTracker assigns jobids starting from _001 every time it restarts. It should not reuse Ids for a large number of jobs ( 10,000 ?)  even if it is restarted. It will make it easy to track and analyze jobs in history by jobids .

Arun C Murthy updated HADOOP-54:
--------------------------------

    Attachment: SequenceFile.20060822.tgz

Here's a patch with a minor tweak to the Sorter (to reuse ValueBytes objects across spills).

I've also attached results of another set of benchmark runs (w/o -check and with -fast) - I've also run it against instrumented code to show no. of ValueBytes objects and total bytes allocated for raw values (note: doesn't imply all of them are allocated at the same time; just total of bytes allocated in the CompressedBytes.reset/UncompressedBytes.reset calls over lifetime of each test case).

> SequenceFile will optionally compress individual values.  But both compression and performance would be much better if sequences of keys and values are compressed together.  Sync marks should only be placed between blocks.  This will require some changes to MapFile too, so that all file positions stored there are the positions of blocks, not entries within blocks.  Probably this can be accomplished by adding a getBlockStartPosition() method to SequenceFile.Writer.

> Servers and clients (client include datanodes, tasktrackers, DFSClients & tasks) should not cache connections or maybe cache them for very short periods of time. Clients should set up & tear down connections to the servers everytime they need to contact the servers (including the heartbeats). If connection is cached, then reuse the existing connection for a few subsequent transactions until the connection expires. The heartbeat interval should be more so that many more clients (order of  tens of thousands) can be accomodated within 1 heartbeat interval.

Streaming framework should not end with a Java stack dump.
All the abnormal conditions should be checked and reported.

Specific conditions that need to be exmplicitly checked by the framework are:
-- does the input exist?
-- do the top level executables or scripts for -mapper and exist

Any other Exceptions should also be cought and explained in an error message.

TextInputFormat does not correctly handle all line endings
----------------------------------------------------------

                 Key: HADOOP-473
                 URL: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-473
             Project: Hadoop
          Issue Type: Bug
          Components: mapred
    Affects Versions: 0.5.0, 0.6.0
         Environment: All environments
            Reporter: Dennis Kubes
         Attachments: text-input-format.patch

The current TextInputFormat readLine method calls break on either a single '\r' or '\n' character.  This causes windows formatted text files '\r' '\n' to leave a trailing '\n' character and the next time the readLine method is called on the same input stream it returns a blank string.  The patch attached corrects this issue by looking for either single or double character line endings and positions the input stream to the next line.  It correctly handles windows, mac, and unix line endings.

> I note that (at least for Nutch 0.8 Generator.Selector.reduce) if mapred.reduce.tasks is the same as the number of tasktrackers, and mapred.tasktracker.tasks.maximum is left at the default of 2, I typically have no reduce tasks running on a few of my tasktrackers, and two reduce tasks running on the same number of other tasktrackers.
> It seems like the jobtracker should assign reduce tasks to tasktrackers in a round robin fashion, so that the distribution will be spread as evenly as possible. The current implementation would seem to waste at least some time if one or more slave machines have to execute two reduce tasks simultaneously while other tasktrackers sit idle, with the amount of wasted time depending on how dependent the reduce tasks were on the slave machine's resources.
> I first thought that perhaps the jobtracker was "overloading" the tasktrackers that had already finished their map tasks (and avoiding those that were still mapping). However, as I understand it, the reduce tasks are all launched at the beginning of the job so that they are all ready and waiting for map output data when it first appears.

Doug Cutting commented on HADOOP-372:
-------------------------------------

I'm having trouble seeing how this is used.  Can you provide some pseudo application code?

Without understanding it, the API looks ugly.  There's a lot of meta-stuff going on--passing classes around rather than instances.  Your prior proposal was much more straightforward: RecordReader creates the Mapper.  What problem with that are you now trying to solve?

> Right now, the user can specify multiple input directories for a map reduce job. 
> However, the files under all the directories are assumed to be in the same format, 
> with the same key/value classes. This proves to be  a serious limit in many situations. 
> Here is an example. Suppose I have three simple tables: 
> one has URLs and their rank values (page ranks), 
> another has URLs and their classification values, 
> and the third one has the URL meta data such as crawl status, last crawl time, etc. 
> Suppose now I need a job to generate a list of URLs to be crawled next. 
> The decision depends on the info in all the three tables.
> Right now, there is no easy way to accomplish this.
> However, this job can be done if the framework allows to specify different inputformats for different input dirs.
> Suppose my three tables are in the following directory respectively: rankTable, classificationTable. and metaDataTable. 
> If we extend JobConf class with the following method (as Owen suggested to me):
>     addInputPath(aPath, anInputFormatClass, anInputKeyClass, anInputValueClass)
> Then I can specify my job as follows:
>     addInputPath(rankTable, SequenceFileInputFormat.class, UTF8.class, DoubleWritable.class)
>     addInputPath(classificationTable, TextInputFormat.class, UTF8,class, UTF8.class)
>     addInputPath(metaDataTable, SequenceFileInputFormat.class, UTF8.class, MyRecord.class)
> If an input directory is added through the current API, it will have the same meaning as it is now. 
> Thus this extension will not affect any applications that do not need this new feature.
> It is relatively easy for the M/R framework to create an appropriate record reader for a map task based on the above information.
> And that is the only change needed for supporting this extension.

-------------------------------------

Is it the stack trace that bothers you?  If you want just a single message, then we could replace the stack trace with the exception name and its message.  If you find particular exception messages confusing, then we should fix things so that a more informative exception is thrown, rather than try to translate the messages to something more informative.

Runping Qi commented on HADOOP-372:
-----------------------------------


I think it may be better to make InputPipeline as an interface:

public interface InputPipeline { 
  public Class createInputFormat(Path inputDir, JobConf conf); 
  public Class getMapper(Path inputDir, JobConf conf); 
  public int getRequestedNumMaps(Path inputDir, JobConf conf); 
} 

In order to customizing input processing pipeline, the user is expected to provide a class
that  implements the interface:

public class MyInputPipeline implements InputPipeline { 
  public MyInputPipeline(); 
  public Class getInputFormat(Path inputDir, JobConf conf); 
  public Class getMapper(Path inputDir, JobConf conf); 
  public int getRequestedNumMaps(Path inputDir, JobConf conf); 
} 

The class provides a argumentless constructor, and implements the logic to 
determine an InputFormat class and a mapper class that apply to the data under the 
specified input directory, and determine
the expected number of mappers for the data under the directory.

The access to this class is through two new methods of JobConf:

   public void setInputPipelineClass(Class cls); 
   public Class getInputPipelineClass(); 

To specify such a class, the user just simply call:
   myJob.setInputPipelineClass(MyInputPipeline.class)


The initTasks method of JobInProgress class can do something like the following:

       String jobFile = profile.getJobFile();

        JobConf jd = new JobConf(localJobFile);
        FileSystem fs = FileSystem.get(conf);
        String userPipelineClassName = jd.get("mapred.input.pipeline.class");
        InputPipeline  inputPipeline ;
        if (userPipelineClassName != null && localJarFile != null) {
          try {
            ClassLoader loader =
            new URLClassLoader(new URL[]{ localFs.pathToFile(localJarFile).toURL() });
            Class inputPipelineClass = Class.forName(userPipelineClassName , true, loader);
            inputPipeline  = (InputPipeline )inputPipelineClass.newInstance(); 
          } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new IOException(e.toString());
          }
        } else {
          inputPipeline = jd.getInputPipeline();
        }
        ArrayList allSplits;
        InputFormat inputFormat;
        InputFormat genericInputFormat;
        Class mapperClass;
        Class genericMapperClass;
        int numMapTasks;
        // code to get the generic input format, mapper class for the job
        
        Path[] dirs = job.getInputPaths();
        for (int i = 0; i < dirs.length; i++) {
                inputFormat = genericInputFormat;
                if (inputPipeline != null) {
                     Class inputFormatClass = inputPipeline.getInputFormat(dirs[i], jd);
                
                     if (inputFormatClass != null) {
                            inputFormat  = (InputFormat)inputFormatClass.newInstance();
                    } 
                    mapperClass = inputPipeline.getMapper(dirs[i], jd);
                    if (mapperClass == null) {
                          mapperClass = genericMapperClass;
                    }
                    int numMapTasks = inputPipeline.getRequestedNumMaps(dirs[i], jd);
                     
                }
                FileSplit[] splits = inputFormat.getSplits(fs, jd, numMapTasks);
                // add the new splits to allSplits
                ....
            }

        FileSplit[] splits = inputFormat.getSplits(fs, jd, numMapTasks);

> Right now, the user can specify multiple input directories for a map reduce job. 
> However, the files under all the directories are assumed to be in the same format, 
> with the same key/value classes. This proves to be  a serious limit in many situations. 
> Here is an example. Suppose I have three simple tables: 
> one has URLs and their rank values (page ranks), 
> another has URLs and their classification values, 
> and the third one has the URL meta data such as crawl status, last crawl time, etc. 
> Suppose now I need a job to generate a list of URLs to be crawled next. 
> The decision depends on the info in all the three tables.
> Right now, there is no easy way to accomplish this.
> However, this job can be done if the framework allows to specify different inputformats for different input dirs.
> Suppose my three tables are in the following directory respectively: rankTable, classificationTable. and metaDataTable. 
> If we extend JobConf class with the following method (as Owen suggested to me):
>     addInputPath(aPath, anInputFormatClass, anInputKeyClass, anInputValueClass)
> Then I can specify my job as follows:
>     addInputPath(rankTable, SequenceFileInputFormat.class, UTF8.class, DoubleWritable.class)
>     addInputPath(classificationTable, TextInputFormat.class, UTF8,class, UTF8.class)
>     addInputPath(metaDataTable, SequenceFileInputFormat.class, UTF8.class, MyRecord.class)
> If an input directory is added through the current API, it will have the same meaning as it is now. 
> Thus this extension will not affect any applications that do not need this new feature.
> It is relatively easy for the M/R framework to create an appropriate record reader for a map task based on the above information.
> And that is the only change needed for supporting this extension.

James P. White commented on HADOOP-473:
---------------------------------------

The proposed patch does read-ahead/seek-back even when the initial newline character is '\n'.  

That is needlessly wasteful.  The could should be simplified to:

      if (c == '\n')
         break;
         
      if (c == '\r') {
        
        long curPos = in.getPos();
        char nextC = (char)in.read();
        
        // EOF -1 is also != '\n' so will work with Mac and EOF
        if (nextC != '\n')) {
          
          // seek back 1 char because the line ending is only 1 char
          in.seek(curPos);
        }

        break;
      }

> The current TextInputFormat readLine method calls break on either a single '\r' or '\n' character.  This causes windows formatted text files '\r' '\n' to leave a trailing '\n' character and the next time the readLine method is called on the same input stream it returns a blank string.  The patch attached corrects this issue by looking for either single or double character line endings and positions the input stream to the next line.  It correctly handles windows, mac, and unix line endings.

Konstantin Shvachko commented on HADOOP-306:
--------------------------------------------

I'd like to discuss the meaning of the safemode.threshold parameter, which defines
when the name node can leave safe mode and start replication/deletion of blocks.
I see at least 2 meanings:
1) % of storage ids reported so far. Storage id is a unique id of a data node
that identifies the storage rather than the data node address.
2) % of blocks reported so far by all data nodes.
They seem to be pretty independent. Even if we have 100% storage ids
reported that does not mean we have 100% blocks.
What 100% means for blocks? Does it mean the name node has
2a) at least one copy of each block or
2b) the complete list of replicas for each block.
All three constraints seem reasonable.
100% in (1) is the best one could physically do, since all storages are
reported, it is just that they have corrupted or missing blocks.
100% in (2a) is the minimal requirement for the name node to start
without any data loss, and
100% in (2b) would be the perfect state of the system.
So the question is what do we really want?

> This is a proposal to improve DFS cluster startup process.
> The data node startup procedures were described and implemented in HADOOP-124.
> I'm trying to extend them to the name node here.
> The main idea is to introduce safe mode, which can be entered manually for administration
> purposes, or automatically when a configurable threshold of active data nodes is breached,
> or at startup when the node stays in safe mode until the minimal limit of active
> nodes is reached.
> This are high level requirements intended to improve the name node and cluster reliability.
>     = The name node safe mode means that the name node is not changing the state of the
>        file system. Meta data is read-only, and block replication / removal is not taking place.
>     = In safe mode the name node accepts data node registrations and
>        processes their block reports.
>     = The name node always starts in safe mode and stays safe until the majority
>         (a configurable parameter: safemode.threshold) of data nodes (or blocks?)
>         is reported.
>     = The name node can also fall into safe mode when the number of non-active
>         (heartbeats stopped coming in) data nodes becomes critical.
>     = The startup "silent period", when the name node is in safe mode and is
>         not issuing any block requests to the data nodes, is initially set to a
>         configurable value safemode.timeout.increment. By the end of the timeout
>         the name node checks the safemode.threshold and decides whether to switch
>         to the normal mode or to stay in safe. If the normal mode criteria is not
>         met, then the silent period is extended by incrementing the safemode timeout.
>     = The name node stays in safe mode not longer than a configurable value of
>         safemode.timeout.max, in which case it logs missing data nodes and shuts
>         itself down.
>     = When the name node switches to normal mode it checks whether all required
>         data nodes have actually registered, based on the list of active data storages
>         from the last session. Then it logs missing nodes, if any, and starts
>         replicating and/or deleting blocks as required.
>     = A historical list of data storages (nodes) ever registered with the cluster is
>         persistently stored in the image and log files. The list is used in two ways:
>         a) at startup to verify whether all nodes have registered, and to report
>         missing nodes;
>         b) at runtime if a data node registers with a new storage id the
>         name node verifies that no new blocks are reported from that storage,
>         which would prevent us from accidentally connecting data nodes from a
>         different cluster.
>     = The name node should have an option to run in safe mode. Starting with
>         that option would mean it never leaves safe mode.
>         This is useful for testing the cluster.
>     = Data nodes that can not connect to the name node for a long time (configurable)
>         should shut down themselves.

Runping Qi commented on HADOOP-372:
-----------------------------------


One correction on my previous comment: InputFormat should extend with the following method:

    FileSplit[] getSplits(FileSystem fs, JobConf jd, Path p, int numMapTasks); 

and the initTasks method should call:
    FileSplit[] splits = inputFormat.getSplits(fs, jd, dirs[i], numMapTasks);

This is less important than the latter (confusing message).
However, to a user of streaming, a stack trace produced by  
infrastructure signal an error in the infrastructure -- so I'd put  
meaningful messages.

Yes, this is more important.
Some can be done by putting more information into exception.
However, certain text may be produced specifically for a human.
E.g.
java.io.FileNotFoundException:  
/export/crawlspace/kryptonite/hadoop/mapred/local/task_0145_r_000000_0/ 
all.2
	at  
org.apache.hadoop.fs.LocalFileSystem.openRaw(LocalFileSystem.java:121)
is less meaningful than:
"it looks like Map step produce no output"

Third:
I believe that Streaming should check the correctness of the task  
before running into exceptions.  (Presence of input files and output  
location, presence of the executables, etc.)
It should also collect the error output of the executables and make it  
available as part of task error output. (Should this be a separate  
Bug?)

> The current strategy of writing a file per target map is consuming a lot of unused buffer space (causing out of memory crashes) and puts a lot of burden on the FS (many opens, inodes used, etc).  
> I propose that we write a single file containing all output and also write an index file IDing which byte range in the file goes to each reduce.  This will remove the issue of buffer waste, address scaling issues with number of open files and generally set us up better for scaling.  It will also have advantages with very small inputs, since the buffer cache will reduce the number of seeks needed and the data serving node can open a single file and just keep it open rather than needing to do directory and open ops on every request.
> The only issue I see is that in cases where the task output is substantiallyu larger than its input, we may need to spill multiple times.  In this case, we can do a merge after all spills are complete (or during the final spill).

Recursive size is going to be expensive, right?   Don't think we should do that by default.

We could provide a link to do a DU to the UI.

> Some improvement requests from Yoram:
> 1. directory browsing: the size, replication and block size fields are unused, and indeed the replication field contains random junk. It would be useful to use these fields to represent the size of the folder (recursive, like du -s), and possibly the number of files in the folder.
> 2. since file sizes are typically very large, introducing a comma thousands separator will make them more readable. 
> 3. For a particular file I have the list of blocks that make it up. It would be useful to see the block placement information - which datanodes are holding that block. That's arguably more relevant than the block contents when clicking on the block.
> 4. a nit - 2048 may be too small a chunk size by default. The overhead of getting the first byte is so high (redirect, connect, handshake etc.) that you may as well get 10-20k as your first shot.

Owen O'Malley commented on HADOOP-263:
--------------------------------------

Ok, looking at the current patch, I have a couple of comments:
  1. The shuffle & sort times should be set to the current time when a later stage is finished. (This would happen when the shuffle or sort finishes in less than a single reporting cycle.) I'd probably put the relevant check/update in the setters for the times in TaskStatus.
  2. You need to pull the replicated code for formatting delta times into StringUtils. And if a field (and all of the larger fields) are 0, you shouldn't print the label except for the last one. (eg. 0 time => "0 secs")
  3. Reporting time to milliseconds when the real granularity is 10 seconds is overkill. Just report to seconds.
  4. You don't need to add the type parameter to the taskdetails.jsp because it is available in TaskStatus.getIsMap()
  5. You should probably add the times to the TaskReport constructor rather than creating the object and setting it to be consistent with the other fields.

Yoram Arnon commented on HADOOP-306:
------------------------------------

OTOH, I'd want the namenode to be able to move out of safe mode with minimal restrictions, to avoid unnecessary manual intervention.
OTOH, I want to avoid unnecessary thrash on startup, while data nodes are connecting.
So any solution would require both a threshold, and some timer once that threshold is reached, to avoid unnecessary replications the second the threshold is reached, before the last datanodes connect.

I'd go with a configuration requiring:
* 100% blocks are available, at least one replica
* allow one more minute for stragglers to connect and report their blocks

typically this would allow up to two nodes to be missing, but if by some magic more nodes are missing and I still have all my data intact, such as when we implement rack aware data placement and a rack goes down, hallelujah - I wait one minute and start re-replicating.

------------------------------------

du is inexpensive. See time comparisons of ls and du on the root of a DFS containing 4500 directories and 250000 files.
'top' on the namenode showed no discernable difference.

lsr is a different story, see timing at the bottom.

Sanjay Dahiya commented on HADOOP-263:
--------------------------------------

  4. You don't need to add the type parameter to the taskdetails.jsp because it is available in TaskStatus.getIsMap() 

I added this to simplify the html generation, taskdetails.jsp is used for both Map and Reduce tasks, we get TaskStatuses from tracker.getTaskStatuses(). The header is generated even if there is no task status. using an extra parameter simplifies this. 

I agree with rest of the comments.

Owen O'Malley commented on HADOOP-372:
--------------------------------------

The question is how the user requests multiple InputPipelines. Either they do:

job.setInputPipeline(MyInputPipelineFactory.class);

or 

job.addInputPath(myInputDir, MyInputFormat.class, MyMapper.class, numMaps);

Setting a class is more similar to the other hooks to control processing in the JobConf, but the expanded addInputPath is more user friendly. I guess you're right that it is better to be friendly. *smile*

Whether the InputFormat's and Mapper's class is stored in the MapTask or FileSplit is a separate question. I think it makes more sense to put into the MapTask since that is a private type and doesn't change an API. Especially when you consider that we are going to generalize the FileSplit to InputSplit.

Finally, I think that getSplits should take a Path[] rather that just a path so that we can split evenly over a set of input paths. So I propose getSplits(FileSystem, Path[], JobConf, int numMaps).

In the long run, as we move Path's over to URL's that include their FileSystem we should drop explicit FileSystem parameters like this. But that is another patch. *grin*

> Right now, the user can specify multiple input directories for a map reduce job. 
> However, the files under all the directories are assumed to be in the same format, 
> with the same key/value classes. This proves to be  a serious limit in many situations. 
> Here is an example. Suppose I have three simple tables: 
> one has URLs and their rank values (page ranks), 
> another has URLs and their classification values, 
> and the third one has the URL meta data such as crawl status, last crawl time, etc. 
> Suppose now I need a job to generate a list of URLs to be crawled next. 
> The decision depends on the info in all the three tables.
> Right now, there is no easy way to accomplish this.
> However, this job can be done if the framework allows to specify different inputformats for different input dirs.
> Suppose my three tables are in the following directory respectively: rankTable, classificationTable. and metaDataTable. 
> If we extend JobConf class with the following method (as Owen suggested to me):
>     addInputPath(aPath, anInputFormatClass, anInputKeyClass, anInputValueClass)
> Then I can specify my job as follows:
>     addInputPath(rankTable, SequenceFileInputFormat.class, UTF8.class, DoubleWritable.class)
>     addInputPath(classificationTable, TextInputFormat.class, UTF8,class, UTF8.class)
>     addInputPath(metaDataTable, SequenceFileInputFormat.class, UTF8.class, MyRecord.class)
> If an input directory is added through the current API, it will have the same meaning as it is now. 
> Thus this extension will not affect any applications that do not need this new feature.
> It is relatively easy for the M/R framework to create an appropriate record reader for a map task based on the above information.
> And that is the only change needed for supporting this extension.

> This is a proposal to improve DFS cluster startup process.
> The data node startup procedures were described and implemented in HADOOP-124.
> I'm trying to extend them to the name node here.
> The main idea is to introduce safe mode, which can be entered manually for administration
> purposes, or automatically when a configurable threshold of active data nodes is breached,
> or at startup when the node stays in safe mode until the minimal limit of active
> nodes is reached.
> This are high level requirements intended to improve the name node and cluster reliability.
>     = The name node safe mode means that the name node is not changing the state of the
>        file system. Meta data is read-only, and block replication / removal is not taking place.
>     = In safe mode the name node accepts data node registrations and
>        processes their block reports.
>     = The name node always starts in safe mode and stays safe until the majority
>         (a configurable parameter: safemode.threshold) of data nodes (or blocks?)
>         is reported.
>     = The name node can also fall into safe mode when the number of non-active
>         (heartbeats stopped coming in) data nodes becomes critical.
>     = The startup "silent period", when the name node is in safe mode and is
>         not issuing any block requests to the data nodes, is initially set to a
>         configurable value safemode.timeout.increment. By the end of the timeout
>         the name node checks the safemode.threshold and decides whether to switch
>         to the normal mode or to stay in safe. If the normal mode criteria is not
>         met, then the silent period is extended by incrementing the safemode timeout.
>     = The name node stays in safe mode not longer than a configurable value of
>         safemode.timeout.max, in which case it logs missing data nodes and shuts
>         itself down.
>     = When the name node switches to normal mode it checks whether all required
>         data nodes have actually registered, based on the list of active data storages
>         from the last session. Then it logs missing nodes, if any, and starts
>         replicating and/or deleting blocks as required.
>     = A historical list of data storages (nodes) ever registered with the cluster is
>         persistently stored in the image and log files. The list is used in two ways:
>         a) at startup to verify whether all nodes have registered, and to report
>         missing nodes;
>         b) at runtime if a data node registers with a new storage id the
>         name node verifies that no new blocks are reported from that storage,
>         which would prevent us from accidentally connecting data nodes from a
>         different cluster.
>     = The name node should have an option to run in safe mode. Starting with
>         that option would mean it never leaves safe mode.
>         This is useful for testing the cluster.
>     = Data nodes that can not connect to the name node for a long time (configurable)
>         should shut down themselves.

Yoram Arnon commented on HADOOP-470:
------------------------------------

 du is inexpensive. See time comparisons of ls and du on the root of a DFS containing 4500 directories and 250000 files.
'top' on the namenode showed no discernable difference.

lsr is a different story, see timing at the bottom.

>time hadoop dfs -du /

real 0m2.217s
user 0m0.473s
sys 0m0.100s

> Some improvement requests from Yoram:
> 1. directory browsing: the size, replication and block size fields are unused, and indeed the replication field contains random junk. It would be useful to use these fields to represent the size of the folder (recursive, like du -s), and possibly the number of files in the folder.
> 2. since file sizes are typically very large, introducing a comma thousands separator will make them more readable. 
> 3. For a particular file I have the list of blocks that make it up. It would be useful to see the block placement information - which datanodes are holding that block. That's arguably more relevant than the block contents when clicking on the block.
> 4. a nit - 2048 may be too small a chunk size by default. The overhead of getting the first byte is so high (redirect, connect, handshake etc.) that you may as well get 10-20k as your first shot.

     [ http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-288?page=all ]

Mahadev konar updated HADOOP-288:
---------------------------------

    Attachment: caching.patch
                test.zip
                test.jar

I have attached two other files to the patch which are small .jar and .zip files needed for the junit tests.

Caching and job.jars:

Two parts to the patch:
1) Unjarring job.jar once for a job
2) Archiving archives/files locally 

1) Unjarring of job.jar
Currently the job.jar is unjarred for each task. This patch makes the framework do the unjarring only once for the job. The current working directory for each task if the same directory where the job is unjarred once. 
So the directory structure now looks like:

tasktracker/jobcache/jod_id/workdir -- the dir where the job is unjarred once
----------------------------/job_id/task_id/task_specific_job.xml

The current working dir for each task is the workdir.

2) Archiving of files- 

i) Each job can ask for a set of archives/files to be localized. The api for that is 
 jobconf.setCacheArchives(comma seperated list of archives)
 or 
 jobconf.setCacheFiles(comma seperated list of files).
 The comma seperated list can be specified as absolute path to files/caches (eg. /user/mahadev/test.jar) if they are in the same dfs as the mapred is running on or else they can be specified using urls as in copyfiles ( dfs://hostname:port/path_to_cache )
 There are two apis provided so that users who do not want their archives to be unarchived by the framework or just want to localize a file should use the second api.

ii) These archives/files should be present in the specified DFS for localizing.
    The user makes sure that these archives are present in the DFS before he submits the job else an error will be thrown that these archives are not present in DFS.

iii) Localization happens across jobs. So each cache archive/file has a key and the key is the url of the cache (in case of absolute path its the absolute path) 

iv) Whenever a job is started, the first tasks for these jobs will localize the archives. 
    The archives are stored in mapred.local/tasktracker/archives/hostname_of_dfs/dfs path of the archive.
    So an archive called /user/mahadev/k.zip  on a dfs running on machine1 would be unarchived in  
    dir =  mapred.local/tasktracker/archives/machine1/user/mahadev/k.zip/
    This dir contains the unarchived contents of k.zip.
    If it is just a file (/user/mahadev/test.txt and not an archive, then it is stored in a directory called 
    mapred.local/tasktracker/archives/machine1/user/mahadev/test.txt/test.txt
    the local directory name contains test.txt directory just to make it similar to the archive structure.

   if no dfs://hostname:port is specified (eg : setcachefiles(/user/mahadev/test.txt)), in that case it is stored in 
  mapred.local/tasktracker/archives/hostname_of_dfs_usedby_mapred/user/mahadev/test.txt

v) The archives are localized only once and checked for each task if they are fresh and need to be refresed or not.
   This is done using md5 checksum of the .crc files for the archives.
   
   Steps:
    a) When a job is submitted, the md5 checksums of the required archives/files in dfs are calculated and are written into the 
       jobconf.
    b) when a task is executing, it matches this md5 to the md5 of the localized cache (stored in memory after it has been localized). If they match its fine to go ahead with this archive.
       If it does not match then the md5 of the .crc of the file in dfs is calculated. If this does not match then the archives have been changed since the job has been submitted, so the tasks fail with this error. If they do match then the cache is refreshed again. 

    c) Two jobs can use the same archives in parallel, but if the second job updates the same archive and tries using the updated archive, then it will fail.
    
vi) How to get the localized cache paths
   An api in the jobconf called jobconf.getLocallizedCacheArchives gives a comma seperated list of localized path of the archives in the same order they had been asked to be localized.
  Also, you can use names for archives. So you could do something like:
 setcachearchives(x=somearchive)
and in the maps/reduces do conf.getNamedCache(x) and it will return the localized path of the cache named x.
vii) Restrictions: 
  Currently only *.zip and *.jar are only supported for archives. 

viii) Also, caching across tasktracker going up and down is not supported. So a tasktracker would lose all caching information once it goes down. The caching information can be reconstructed when the task tracker comes up but the support is not available in this patch.

ix) When are the caches deleted?
    A soft limit on the cache directory is a configuration parameter in the hadoop-default set to 10GB. So whenever the cache directory size goes beyond this size the framework will try deleting local caches that are not being used.

> RFC: Efficient file caching 
> (on Hadoop Task nodes, for benefit of MapReduce Tasks)
> ------------------------------------------------------
> We will start implementing this soon. Please provide feedback and improvements to this plan.
> The header "Options:" indicates places where simple choices must be made.
> Problem:
> -------
> o MapReduce tasks require access to additional out-of-band data ("dictionaries")
> This out-of-band data is:
> o in addition to the map/reduce inputs.
> o large (1GB+)
> o broadcast (same data is required on all the Task nodes)
> o changes "infrequently", in particular:
> oo it is always constant for all the Tasks in a Job. 
> oo it is often constant for a month at a time 
> oo it may be shared across team members
> o sometimes used by pure-Java MapReduce programs
> o sometimes used by non-Java MapReduce programs (using Hadoop-Streaming)
> o (future) used by programs that use HDFS and Task-trackers but not MapReduce.
> Existing Solutions to the problem:
> ---------------------------------
> These solutions are not good enough. The present proposal is to do Sol 1 with caching.
> Sol 1: Pure Hadoop: package the out-of-band data in the MapReduce Job jar file.
> Sol 2: Non  Hadoop: for each task node run rsync from single source for data.
> Sol 3: Non  Hadoop: use BitTorrent, etc.
> Sol.1 is correct but slow for many reasons:
>  The Job submitter must recreate a large jar(tar) file for every Job.
>   (The jar contains both changing programs and stable dictionaries)
>  The large Jar file must be propagated from the client to HDFS with 
>  a large replication factor. 
>  At the beginning of every Task, the Task tracker gets the job jar from HDFS 
>  and unjars it in the working directory. This can dominate task execution time.
>  
> Sol.2 has nice properties but also some problems.
>  It does not scale well with large clusters (many concurrent rsync read requests i.e. single-source broadcast)
>  It assumes that Hadoop users can upload data using rsync to the cluster nodes. As a policy, this is not allowed.
>  It requires rsync.
>  
> Sol.3 alleviates the rsync scalability problems but 
>       It is a dependency on an external system. 
>       We want something simpler and more tightly integrated with Hadoop.
>       
> Staging (uploading) out-of-band data:
> ------------------------------------
> The out-of-band data will often originate on the local filesystem of a user machine 
>  (i.e. a MapReduce job submitter)
> Nevertheless it makes sense to use HDFS to store the original out-of-band data because:
> o HDFS has (wide) replication. This enables scalable broadcast later.
> o HDFS is an available channel to move data from clients to all task machines.
> o HDFS is convenient as a shared location among Hadoop team members.
> Accessing (downloading) out-of-band data:
> ----------------------------------------
> The non-Java MapReduce programs do not have or want[1] APIs for HDFS.
> Instead these programs just want to access out-of-band data as 
>  local files at predefined paths.
> ([1] Existing programs should be reusable with no changes. 
>  This is often possible bec. communication is over stdin/stdout.)
> Job's jar file as a special case:
> --------------------------------
> One use case is to allow users to make the job jar itself cachable.
> This is only useful in cases where NOTHING changes when a job is resubmitted
>  (no MapRed code changes and no changes in shipped data)
> This situation might occur with an 'extractor' job (gets data from an external source: like Nutch crawler)
> Currently the Hadoop mapred-jar mechanism works in this way:
>  the job jar data is unjarred in the "working directory" of the Task 
>  the jar contains both MapRed java code (added to classpath)
> Cache synchronization:
> ---------------------
> The efficient implementation of the out-of-band data distribution
> is mostly a cache synchronization problem.
> A list of the various aspects where choices must be made follows.
> Cache key:
> ---------
> How do you test that the cached copy is out-of-date?
> Options: 
> 1. the archive/file timestamp 
> 2. the MD5 of the archive/file content
> Comparing source and destination Timestamps is problematic bec. it assumes synchronized clocks.
> Also there is no last-modif metadata in HDFS (for good reasons, like scalability of metadata ops)
> Timestamps stored with the source ('last-propagate-time') do 
>  not require synchronized clocks, only locally monotonic time. 
> (and the worse which can happen at daylight-savings switch is a missed update or an extra-update)
> The cache code could store a copy of the local timestamp 
> in the same way that it caches the value of the content hash along with the source data.
>  
> Cachable unit:
> -------------
> Options: individual files or archives or both.
> Note:
> At the API level, directories will be processed recursively 
> (and the local FS directories will parallel HDFS directories)
> So bulk operations are always possible using directories.
> The question here is whether to handle archives as an additional bulk mechanism.
> Archives are special because:
> o unarchiving occurs transparently as part of the cache sync
> o The cache key is computed on the archive and preserved although 
>   the archive itself is not preserved.
> Supported archive format will be: tar (maybe tgz or compressed jar)
> Archive detection test: by filename extension ".tar" or ".jar"
> Suppose we don't handle archives as special files:
> Pros:
>  o less code, no discussion about which archive formats are supported
>  o fine for large dictionary files. And when files are not large, user may as well
>    put them in the Job jar as usual.
>  o user code could always check and unarchive specific cached files
>    (as a side-effect of MapRed task initialization)
> Cons:
>  o handling small files may be inefficient 
>   (multiple HDFS operations, multiple hash computation, 
>    one 'metadata' hash file along with each small file)
>  o It will not be possible to handle the Job's jar file as a special case of caching 
> Cache isolation: 
> ---------------
> In some cases it may be a problem if the cached HDFS files are updated while a Job is in progress:
> The file may become unavailable for a short period of time and some tasks fail.
> The file may change (atomically) and different tasks use a different version.
> This isolation problem is not addressed in this proposal.
> Standard solutions to the isolation problem are:
> o Assume that Jobs and interfering cache updates won't occur concurrently.
> o Put a version number in the HDFS file paths and refer to a hard-coded version in the Job code.
> o Before running the MapRed job, run a non-distributed application that tests
>   what is the latest available version of the out-of-band data. 
>   Then make this version available to the MapRed job.
>   Two ways to do this. 
>   o either set a job property just-in-time:
>     addCachePathPair("/mydata/v1234/", "localcache/mydata_latest"); 
>     (see Job Configuration for meaning of this)
>   o or publish the decision as an HDFS file containing the version.
>     then rely on user code to read the version, and manually populate the cache:
>     Cache.syncCache("/hdfs/path/fileordir", "relative/local/fileordir");
>     (see MapReduce API for meaning of this)
> Cache synchronization stages:
> ----------------------------
> There are two stages: Client-to-HDFS and HDFS-to-TaskTracker
> o Client-to-HDFS stage.
> Options: A simple option is to not do anything here, i.e. rely on the user.
> This is a reasonable option given previous remarks on the role of HDFS:
>  HDFS is a staging/publishing area and a natural shared location.
> In particular this means that the system need not track 
> where the client files come from.
> o HDFS-to-TaskTracker:
> Client-to-HDFS synchronization (if done at all) should happen before this.
> Then HDFS-to-TaskTracker synchronization must happen right before 
> the data is needed on a node.
> MapReduce cache API:
> -------------------
> Options:
> 1. No change in MapReduce framework code:
> require the user to put this logic in map() (or reduce) function:
>  in MyMapper constructor (or in map() on first record) user is asked to add:
>  
>     Cache.syncCache("/hdfs/path/fileordir", "relative/local/fileordir");
>     Cache.syncCache("..."); //etc.
>   
> -----
> 2. Put this logic in MapReduce framework and use Job properties to
>    communicate the list of pairs (hdfs path; local path)
>  
> Directories are processed recursively.
> If archives are treated specially then they are unarchived on destination.
>  
> MapReduce Job Configuration:
> ---------------------------
> Options:
> with No change in MapReduce framework code (see above)
>  no special Job configuration: 
>    it is up to the MapRed writer to configure and run the cache operations.
> ---
> with Logic in MapReduce framework (see above)
>  some simple Job configuration
> JobConf.addCachePathPair(String, String)
> JobConf.addCachePathPair("/hdfs/path/fileordir", "relative/local/fileordir");

Currently o.a.h.m.JobConf has construcor:
JobConf(Configuration conf, Class exampleClass)

which calls
    this(conf) which has
    initialize()

initialize method has:
    addDefaultResource("mapred-default.xml");

    which leads to properties of JobConf to be cleared ->
    reload is triggered.

This leads to the fact that the conf values submitted to constructor are 
not actually used, well they
kind of are for a short time because the properties are copied in 
constructor of Configuration, but then
there comes the addDefaultResource which leads to properties being 
flushed and
config resources reparsed and dynamically set values get lost.

I see that javadoc only talks about inheriting the settings, but is it 
really supposed to be working
the way it is now or should the submitted (possibly dynamically set) 
configuration variables and
values be preserved?

Doug Cutting resolved HADOOP-468.
---------------------------------

    Fix Version/s: 0.6.0
       Resolution: Fixed

I just committed this.  I renamed the environment variable from HADOOP_NICE_VALUE to HADOOP_NICENESS, and also added an entry to hadoop-env.sh.template.  (hadoop-env.sh is not in svn, so that user modifications to it are not overwritten.  Instead we copy such files from a template file at build time.)

Thanks, Vetle!

Doug Cutting commented on HADOOP-312:
-------------------------------------

A few more issues:

The IS_CACHING_DISABLED field should not be all caps, since it is not a constant.

When connection caching is disabled then the connection threads should exit when there are no outstanding responses.  Then the connections.remove(address) could also be moved to Connection.close(), removing some duplicate logic.

Finally, the check of 'cachingDisabled' could be moved to be inside of incrementRef and decrementRef, rather than around each call, changing these to something like:

private void incrementRef() {
  if (cachingDisabled) {
    return;
  }
  synchronized (this) {
    ...
  }
}

> Servers and clients (client include datanodes, tasktrackers, DFSClients & tasks) should not cache connections or maybe cache them for very short periods of time. Clients should set up & tear down connections to the servers everytime they need to contact the servers (including the heartbeats). If connection is cached, then reuse the existing connection for a few subsequent transactions until the connection expires. The heartbeat interval should be more so that many more clients (order of  tens of thousands) can be accomodated within 1 heartbeat interval.

> RFC: Efficient file caching 
> (on Hadoop Task nodes, for benefit of MapReduce Tasks)
> ------------------------------------------------------
> We will start implementing this soon. Please provide feedback and improvements to this plan.
> The header "Options:" indicates places where simple choices must be made.
> Problem:
> -------
> o MapReduce tasks require access to additional out-of-band data ("dictionaries")
> This out-of-band data is:
> o in addition to the map/reduce inputs.
> o large (1GB+)
> o broadcast (same data is required on all the Task nodes)
> o changes "infrequently", in particular:
> oo it is always constant for all the Tasks in a Job. 
> oo it is often constant for a month at a time 
> oo it may be shared across team members
> o sometimes used by pure-Java MapReduce programs
> o sometimes used by non-Java MapReduce programs (using Hadoop-Streaming)
> o (future) used by programs that use HDFS and Task-trackers but not MapReduce.
> Existing Solutions to the problem:
> ---------------------------------
> These solutions are not good enough. The present proposal is to do Sol 1 with caching.
> Sol 1: Pure Hadoop: package the out-of-band data in the MapReduce Job jar file.
> Sol 2: Non  Hadoop: for each task node run rsync from single source for data.
> Sol 3: Non  Hadoop: use BitTorrent, etc.
> Sol.1 is correct but slow for many reasons:
>  The Job submitter must recreate a large jar(tar) file for every Job.
>   (The jar contains both changing programs and stable dictionaries)
>  The large Jar file must be propagated from the client to HDFS with 
>  a large replication factor. 
>  At the beginning of every Task, the Task tracker gets the job jar from HDFS 
>  and unjars it in the working directory. This can dominate task execution time.
>  
> Sol.2 has nice properties but also some problems.
>  It does not scale well with large clusters (many concurrent rsync read requests i.e. single-source broadcast)
>  It assumes that Hadoop users can upload data using rsync to the cluster nodes. As a policy, this is not allowed.
>  It requires rsync.
>  
> Sol.3 alleviates the rsync scalability problems but 
>       It is a dependency on an external system. 
>       We want something simpler and more tightly integrated with Hadoop.
>       
> Staging (uploading) out-of-band data:
> ------------------------------------
> The out-of-band data will often originate on the local filesystem of a user machine 
>  (i.e. a MapReduce job submitter)
> Nevertheless it makes sense to use HDFS to store the original out-of-band data because:
> o HDFS has (wide) replication. This enables scalable broadcast later.
> o HDFS is an available channel to move data from clients to all task machines.
> o HDFS is convenient as a shared location among Hadoop team members.
> Accessing (downloading) out-of-band data:
> ----------------------------------------
> The non-Java MapReduce programs do not have or want[1] APIs for HDFS.
> Instead these programs just want to access out-of-band data as 
>  local files at predefined paths.
> ([1] Existing programs should be reusable with no changes. 
>  This is often possible bec. communication is over stdin/stdout.)
> Job's jar file as a special case:
> --------------------------------
> One use case is to allow users to make the job jar itself cachable.
> This is only useful in cases where NOTHING changes when a job is resubmitted
>  (no MapRed code changes and no changes in shipped data)
> This situation might occur with an 'extractor' job (gets data from an external source: like Nutch crawler)
> Currently the Hadoop mapred-jar mechanism works in this way:
>  the job jar data is unjarred in the "working directory" of the Task 
>  the jar contains both MapRed java code (added to classpath)
> Cache synchronization:
> ---------------------
> The efficient implementation of the out-of-band data distribution
> is mostly a cache synchronization problem.
> A list of the various aspects where choices must be made follows.
> Cache key:
> ---------
> How do you test that the cached copy is out-of-date?
> Options: 
> 1. the archive/file timestamp 
> 2. the MD5 of the archive/file content
> Comparing source and destination Timestamps is problematic bec. it assumes synchronized clocks.
> Also there is no last-modif metadata in HDFS (for good reasons, like scalability of metadata ops)
> Timestamps stored with the source ('last-propagate-time') do 
>  not require synchronized clocks, only locally monotonic time. 
> (and the worse which can happen at daylight-savings switch is a missed update or an extra-update)
> The cache code could store a copy of the local timestamp 
> in the same way that it caches the value of the content hash along with the source data.
>  
> Cachable unit:
> -------------
> Options: individual files or archives or both.
> Note:
> At the API level, directories will be processed recursively 
> (and the local FS directories will parallel HDFS directories)
> So bulk operations are always possible using directories.
> The question here is whether to handle archives as an additional bulk mechanism.
> Archives are special because:
> o unarchiving occurs transparently as part of the cache sync
> o The cache key is computed on the archive and preserved although 
>   the archive itself is not preserved.
> Supported archive format will be: tar (maybe tgz or compressed jar)
> Archive detection test: by filename extension ".tar" or ".jar"
> Suppose we don't handle archives as special files:
> Pros:
>  o less code, no discussion about which archive formats are supported
>  o fine for large dictionary files. And when files are not large, user may as well
>    put them in the Job jar as usual.
>  o user code could always check and unarchive specific cached files
>    (as a side-effect of MapRed task initialization)
> Cons:
>  o handling small files may be inefficient 
>   (multiple HDFS operations, multiple hash computation, 
>    one 'metadata' hash file along with each small file)
>  o It will not be possible to handle the Job's jar file as a special case of caching 
> Cache isolation: 
> ---------------
> In some cases it may be a problem if the cached HDFS files are updated while a Job is in progress:
> The file may become unavailable for a short period of time and some tasks fail.
> The file may change (atomically) and different tasks use a different version.
> This isolation problem is not addressed in this proposal.
> Standard solutions to the isolation problem are:
> o Assume that Jobs and interfering cache updates won't occur concurrently.
> o Put a version number in the HDFS file paths and refer to a hard-coded version in the Job code.
> o Before running the MapRed job, run a non-distributed application that tests
>   what is the latest available version of the out-of-band data. 
>   Then make this version available to the MapRed job.
>   Two ways to do this. 
>   o either set a job property just-in-time:
>     addCachePathPair("/mydata/v1234/", "localcache/mydata_latest"); 
>     (see Job Configuration for meaning of this)
>   o or publish the decision as an HDFS file containing the version.
>     then rely on user code to read the version, and manually populate the cache:
>     Cache.syncCache("/hdfs/path/fileordir", "relative/local/fileordir");
>     (see MapReduce API for meaning of this)
> Cache synchronization stages:
> ----------------------------
> There are two stages: Client-to-HDFS and HDFS-to-TaskTracker
> o Client-to-HDFS stage.
> Options: A simple option is to not do anything here, i.e. rely on the user.
> This is a reasonable option given previous remarks on the role of HDFS:
>  HDFS is a staging/publishing area and a natural shared location.
> In particular this means that the system need not track

Devaraj Das commented on HADOOP-312:
------------------------------------

Actually, I thought that I could save the overhead of destroying/creating threads every so often (could be as frequent as once every second). In the current patch, client connection thread will be created just once for every server and that is destroyed & re-created only when there is an error in receiving server response, etc.

Regarding the check for cachingDisabled, it's outside incrementRef/decrementRef since I wanted to avoid so-many-unnecessary method invocations when caching is disabled.

I agree with the IS_CACHING_DISABLED comment that it should not be all caps.

Makes sense ?

> Servers and clients (client include datanodes, tasktrackers, DFSClients & tasks) should not cache connections or maybe cache them for very short periods of time. Clients should set up & tear down connections to the servers everytime they need to contact the servers (including the heartbeats). If connection is cached, then reuse the existing connection for a few subsequent transactions until the connection expires. The heartbeat interval should be more so that many more clients (order of  tens of thousands) can be accomodated within 1 heartbeat interval.

Arun C Murthy commented on HADOOP-441:
--------------------------------------

Doug,

  Conceptually this makes sense, I'm all for it.
  
  There is one irritant with the create methods for DeflaterOutputStream/InflaterInputStream in CompressionCodec... it's got to do with the Deflater/Inflater fields for streams respectively. Specifically the issue is we need to pass in our own Deflater/Inflater objects in order to be able to 'reset' the internal compressor/decompressor of the respective streams; this ability to 'reset' is otherwise absent (since we can't access those 'protected' fields) as is crucial for SequenceFile's block compression (in the case where next(key,val) is followed by next(key) and block boundary is hit). We probably need to define our own interface for compressor/decompressor streams or atleast have the CompressionCodec work with an extended class of DeflaterOutputStream/InflaterInputStream (which will have the 'reset' functionality we need).

 Thoughts?

> SequenceFiles should support 'custom compressors' which can be specified by the user on creation of the file. 
> Readily available packages for gzip and zip (java.util.zip) are among obvious choices to support. Of course there will be hooks so that other compressors can be added in future as long as there is a way to construct (input/output) streams on top of the compressor/decompressor.
> The 'classname' of the 'custom compressor/decompressor' could be stored in the header of the SequenceFile which can then be used by SequenceFile.Reader to figure out the appropriate 'decompressor'. Thus I propose we add constructors to SequenceFile.Writer which take in the 'classname' of the compressor's input/output stream classes (e.g. DeflaterOutputStream/InflaterInputStream or GZIPOutputStream/GZIPInputStream), which acts as the hook for future compressors/decompressors.

Owen O'Malley commented on HADOOP-441:
--------------------------------------

I like the idea, but DeflaterOutputStream and InflaterInputStream are zlib specific.

How about three interfaces in hadoop.io:

public interface CompressionOutputStream {
...
}

public interface CompressionInputStream {
...
}

public interface CompressionCodec {
  CompressionOutputStream createOutputStream(OutputStream out);
  CompressionInputStream createInputStream(InputStream in);
}

eric baldeschwieler commented on HADOOP-472:
--------------------------------------------

sounds like checking the reconditions before executing is a good idea.

The result of this could just be clearer exceptions.

The question is, should this happen?  If so, it is not an exception.  If not, it is IMO.

Doug Cutting commented on HADOOP-288:
-------------------------------------

The LocalDU class should rather be a method on FileUtils, as should the UnZip utility.

DistributedCache should not be public, nor should the methods you add to TaskTracker.  The only public API for this new feature is the two new JobConf methods, right?

> RFC: Efficient file caching 
> (on Hadoop Task nodes, for benefit of MapReduce Tasks)
> ------------------------------------------------------
> We will start implementing this soon. Please provide feedback and improvements to this plan.
> The header "Options:" indicates places where simple choices must be made.
> Problem:
> -------
> o MapReduce tasks require access to additional out-of-band data ("dictionaries")
> This out-of-band data is:
> o in addition to the map/reduce inputs.
> o large (1GB+)
> o broadcast (same data is required on all the Task nodes)
> o changes "infrequently", in particular:
> oo it is always constant for all the Tasks in a Job. 
> oo it is often constant for a month at a time 
> oo it may be shared across team members
> o sometimes used by pure-Java MapReduce programs
> o sometimes used by non-Java MapReduce programs (using Hadoop-Streaming)
> o (future) used by programs that use HDFS and Task-trackers but not MapReduce.
> Existing Solutions to the problem:
> ---------------------------------
> These solutions are not good enough. The present proposal is to do Sol 1 with caching.
> Sol 1: Pure Hadoop: package the out-of-band data in the MapReduce Job jar file.
> Sol 2: Non  Hadoop: for each task node run rsync from single source for data.
> Sol 3: Non  Hadoop: use BitTorrent, etc.
> Sol.1 is correct but slow for many reasons:
>  The Job submitter must recreate a large jar(tar) file for every Job.
>   (The jar contains both changing programs and stable dictionaries)
>  The large Jar file must be propagated from the client to HDFS with 
>  a large replication factor. 
>  At the beginning of every Task, the Task tracker gets the job jar from HDFS 
>  and unjars it in the working directory. This can dominate task execution time.
>  
> Sol.2 has nice properties but also some problems.
>  It does not scale well with large clusters (many concurrent rsync read requests i.e. single-source broadcast)
>  It assumes that Hadoop users can upload data using rsync to the cluster nodes. As a policy, this is not allowed.
>  It requires rsync.
>  
> Sol.3 alleviates the rsync scalability problems but 
>       It is a dependency on an external system. 
>       We want something simpler and more tightly integrated with Hadoop.
>       
> Staging (uploading) out-of-band data:
> ------------------------------------
> The out-of-band data will often originate on the local filesystem of a user machine 
>  (i.e. a MapReduce job submitter)
> Nevertheless it makes sense to use HDFS to store the original out-of-band data because:
> o HDFS has (wide) replication. This enables scalable broadcast later.
> o HDFS is an available channel to move data from clients to all task machines.
> o HDFS is convenient as a shared location among Hadoop team members.
> Accessing (downloading) out-of-band data:
> ----------------------------------------
> The non-Java MapReduce programs do not have or want[1] APIs for HDFS.
> Instead these programs just want to access out-of-band data as 
>  local files at predefined paths.
> ([1] Existing programs should be reusable with no changes. 
>  This is often possible bec. communication is over stdin/stdout.)
> Job's jar file as a special case:
> --------------------------------
> One use case is to allow users to make the job jar itself cachable.
> This is only useful in cases where NOTHING changes when a job is resubmitted
>  (no MapRed code changes and no changes in shipped data)
> This situation might occur with an 'extractor' job (gets data from an external source: like Nutch crawler)
> Currently the Hadoop mapred-jar mechanism works in this way:
>  the job jar data is unjarred in the "working directory" of the Task 
>  the jar contains both MapRed java code (added to classpath)
> Cache synchronization:
> ---------------------
> The efficient implementation of the out-of-band data distribution
> is mostly a cache synchronization problem.
> A list of the various aspects where choices must be made follows.
> Cache key:
> ---------
> How do you test that the cached copy is out-of-date?
> Options: 
> 1. the archive/file timestamp 
> 2. the MD5 of the archive/file content
> Comparing source and destination Timestamps is problematic bec. it assumes synchronized clocks.
> Also there is no last-modif metadata in HDFS (for good reasons, like scalability of metadata ops)
> Timestamps stored with the source ('last-propagate-time') do 
>  not require synchronized clocks, only locally monotonic time. 
> (and the worse which can happen at daylight-savings switch is a missed update or an extra-update)
> The cache code could store a copy of the local timestamp 
> in the same way that it caches the value of the content hash along with the source data.
>  
> Cachable unit:
> -------------
> Options: individual files or archives or both.
> Note:
> At the API level, directories will be processed recursively 
> (and the local FS directories will parallel HDFS directories)
> So bulk operations are always possible using directories.
> The question here is whether to handle archives as an additional bulk mechanism.
> Archives are special because:
> o unarchiving occurs transparently as part of the cache sync
> o The cache key is computed on the archive and preserved although 
>   the archive itself is not preserved.
> Supported archive format will be: tar (maybe tgz or compressed jar)
> Archive detection test: by filename extension ".tar" or ".jar"
> Suppose we don't handle archives as special files:
> Pros:
>  o less code, no discussion about which archive formats are supported
>  o fine for large dictionary files. And when files are not large, user may as well
>    put them in the Job jar as usual.
>  o user code could always check and unarchive specific cached files
>    (as a side-effect of MapRed task initialization)
> Cons:
>  o handling small files may be inefficient 
>   (multiple HDFS operations, multiple hash computation, 
>    one 'metadata' hash file along with each small file)
>  o It will not be possible to handle the Job's jar file as a special case of caching 
> Cache isolation: 
> ---------------
> In some cases it may be a problem if the cached HDFS files are updated while a Job is in progress:
> The file may become unavailable for a short period of time and some tasks fail.
> The file may change (atomically) and different tasks use a different version.
> This isolation problem is not addressed in this proposal.
> Standard solutions to the isolation problem are:
> o Assume that Jobs and interfering cache updates won't occur concurrently.
> o Put a version number in the HDFS file paths and refer to a hard-coded version in the Job code.
> o Before running the MapRed job, run a non-distributed application that tests
>   what is the latest available version of the out-of-band data. 
>   Then make this version available to the MapRed job.
>   Two ways to do this. 
>   o either set a job property just-in-time:
>     addCachePathPair("/mydata/v1234/", "localcache/mydata_latest"); 
>     (see Job Configuration for meaning of this)
>   o or publish the decision as an HDFS file containing the version.
>     then rely on user code to read the version, and manually populate the cache:
>     Cache.syncCache("/hdfs/path/fileordir", "relative/local/fileordir");
>     (see MapReduce API for meaning of this)
> Cache synchronization stages:
> ----------------------------
> There are two stages: Client-to-HDFS and HDFS-to-TaskTracker
> o Client-to-HDFS stage.
> Options: A simple option is to not do anything here, i.e. rely on the user.
> This is a reasonable option given previous remarks on the role of HDFS:
>  HDFS is a staging/publishing area and a natural shared location.
> In particular this means that the system need not track 
> where the client files come from.
> o HDFS-to-TaskTracker:
> Client-to-HDFS synchronization (if done at all) should happen before this.
> Then HDFS-to-TaskTracker synchronization must happen right before 
> the data is needed on a node.
> MapReduce cache API:
> -------------------
> Options:
> 1. No change in MapReduce framework code:
> require the user to put this logic in map() (or reduce) function:
>  in MyMapper constructor (or in map() on first record) user is asked to add:
>  
>     Cache.syncCache("/hdfs/path/fileordir", "relative/local/fileordir");
>     Cache.syncCache("..."); //etc.
>   
> -----
> 2. Put this logic in MapReduce framework and use Job properties to
>    communicate the list of pairs (hdfs path; local path)
>  
> Directories are processed recursively.
> If archives are treated specially then they are unarchived on destination.
>  
> MapReduce Job Configuration:

In a comment on HADOOP-372, Owen suggests that the getSplits() method should look like:

Split[] getSplits(URI[], JobConf, int numMaps);

I think that's a good idea.

Doug Cutting commented on HADOOP-372:
-------------------------------------

> job.addInputPath(myInputDir, MyInputFormat.class, MyMapper.class, numMaps); 

Why can't this simply be

job.addInputPath(myInputDir, MyInputFormat.class);

and let the mapper be determined by the inputformat?

I also don't think that users should typically be specifying the number of map tasks.  Their code should run unchanged on clusters of various sizes.  The number of map tasks should thus be determined dynamically when splitting.

I also think the above should simply be syntactic sugar for:

job.setInputFormat(MyInputFormat.class)
job.set("my.input.dirs", "foo,bar");
job.set("my.mappers", "FooMapper,BarMapper");

Then implement MyInputFormat to process my.input.dirs and my.mappers.

In other words, we should foremost first make it possible to do this in user code, then perhaps provide some utilities that simplify things.  So the first patch I'd like to see is mappers from record readers.  Then we can write some InputFormats that use these new features and perhaps promote some of them into the standard public APIs.  Does this make sense?  Am I missing something?

> Right now, the user can specify multiple input directories for a map reduce job.

> Here is an example. Suppose I have three simple tables:

> another has URLs and their classification values, 
> and the third one has the URL meta data such as crawl status, last crawl time, etc. 
> Suppose now I need a job to generate a list of URLs to be crawled next. 
> The decision depends on the info in all the three tables.
> Right now, there is no easy way to accomplish this.
> However, this job can be done if the framework allows to specify different inputformats for different input dirs.
> Suppose my three tables are in the following directory respectively: rankTable, classificationTable. and metaDataTable. 
> If we extend JobConf class with the following method (as Owen suggested to me):
>     addInputPath(aPath, anInputFormatClass, anInputKeyClass, anInputValueClass)
> Then I can specify my job as follows:
>     addInputPath(rankTable, SequenceFileInputFormat.class, UTF8.class, DoubleWritable.class)
>     addInputPath(classificationTable, TextInputFormat.class, UTF8,class, UTF8.class)
>     addInputPath(metaDataTable, SequenceFileInputFormat.class, UTF8.class, MyRecord.class)
> If an input directory is added through the current API, it will have the same meaning as it is now. 
> Thus this extension will not affect any applications that do not need this new feature.
> It is relatively easy for the M/R framework to create an appropriate record reader for a map task based on the above information.
> And that is the only change needed for supporting this extension.

Owen O'Malley commented on HADOOP-54:
-------------------------------------

A minor quible is that when you are basically implementing an Enum, we should probably use the name "valueOf(String)" instead of "getCompressionType(String)" to be forward compatible with the java 1.5 signature for that functionality.

I'd also like to see some performance numbers for straight reads and writes of the seq3 and seq4 block compressed files.

> SequenceFile will optionally compress individual values.  But both compression and performance would be much better if sequences of keys and values are compressed together.  Sync marks should only be placed between blocks.  This will require some changes to MapFile too, so that all file positions stored there are the positions of blocks, not entries within blocks.  Probably this can be accomplished by adding a getBlockStartPosition() method to SequenceFile.Writer.

Doug Cutting commented on HADOOP-470:
-------------------------------------

Looking at the code I see that du does walk the entire tree, but the walk is server-side and quite efficient.  On the other hand, we perform the 'du' calculation for every directory stat'd, always returning it pre-computed with the other file metadata.  That's probably excessive.  We should probably make a separate RPC for 'du'.

> Some improvement requests from Yoram:
> 1. directory browsing: the size, replication and block size fields are unused, and indeed the replication field contains random junk. It would be useful to use these fields to represent the size of the folder (recursive, like du -s), and possibly the number of files in the folder.
> 2. since file sizes are typically very large, introducing a comma thousands separator will make them more readable. 
> 3. For a particular file I have the list of blocks that make it up. It would be useful to see the block placement information - which datanodes are holding that block. That's arguably more relevant than the block contents when clicking on the block.
> 4. a nit - 2048 may be too small a chunk size by default. The overhead of getting the first byte is so high (redirect, connect, handshake etc.) that you may as well get 10-20k as your first shot.

> SequenceFiles should support 'custom compressors' which can be specified by the user on creation of the file. 
> Readily available packages for gzip and zip (java.util.zip) are among obvious choices to support. Of course there will be hooks so that other compressors can be added in future as long as there is a way to construct (input/output) streams on top of the compressor/decompressor.
> The 'classname' of the 'custom compressor/decompressor' could be stored in the header of the SequenceFile which can then be used by SequenceFile.Reader to figure out the appropriate 'decompressor'. Thus I propose we add constructors to SequenceFile.Writer which take in the 'classname' of the compressor's input/output stream classes (e.g. DeflaterOutputStream/InflaterInputStream or GZIPOutputStream/GZIPInputStream), which acts as the hook for future compressors/decompressors.

support compressed text files as input and output
-------------------------------------------------

                 Key: HADOOP-474
                 URL: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-474
             Project: Hadoop
          Issue Type: Improvement
          Components: mapred
    Affects Versions: 0.5.0
            Reporter: Owen O'Malley
         Assigned To: Owen O'Malley
             Fix For: 0.6.0


I'd like TextInputFomat and TextOutputFormat to automatically compress and uncompress text files when they are read and written. Furthermore, I'd like to be able to use custom compressors as defined in HADOOP-441. Therefore, I propose:

Adding a map of compression codecs in the server config files:

io.compression.codecs = "<suffix>=<codec class>,..."

so the default would be something like:

<property>
  <name>io.compression.codecs</name>
  <value>.gz=org.apache.hadoop.io.GZipCodec,.Z=org.apache.hadoop.io.ZipCodec</value>
  <description>A list of file suffixes and the codecs for them.</description>
</property>

note that the suffix can include multiple "." so you could support suffixes like ".tar.gz", but they are just treated as literals against the end of the filename.

If the TextInputFormat is dealing with such a file, it:
  1. makes a single split
  2. decompresses automatically

On the output side, if mapred.output.compress is true, then TextOutputFormat would use a new property mapred.output.compression.codec that would define the codec to use to compress the outputs,  defaulting to gzip.

--------------------------------------

The problem with that is often I won't want to use a non-standard InputFormat. A very typical case is to have the same input format, but different Mappers.

job.addInputPath("foo", TextInputFormat.class, FooMapper.class);
job.addInputPath("bar", TextInputFormat.class, BarMapper.class);

The same applies to SequenceFileInputFormat (or combinations of the two), especially now that the input key/value types are created by the RecordReader.

Doug Cutting commented on HADOOP-372:
-------------------------------------

> A very typical case is to have the same input format, but different Mappers

But, if the mapper is a function of the input format this can instead be:

job.addInputPath("foo", FooInput.class);
job.addInputPath("bar", BarInput.class);

Where FooInput is defined with something like:

public class FooInput extends TextInput {
  public void map(...) { ... };
}

In other words, if you're going to define custom mappers anyway, then it's no more work to define custom Input formats.

-------------------------------------

> I thought that I could save the overhead of destroying/creating threads [ ...]

Threads should be cheap to create, but keeping too many around can be expensive.  Again, I think the life of the thread should be the same as the life of the connection.

> I wanted to avoid so-many-unnecessary method invocations when caching is disabled.

Method invocations that check a flag are plenty fast.  This is not an inner loop.  I'd rather have this code be easier to maintain than a few nanoseconds faster.

> Servers and clients (client include datanodes, tasktrackers, DFSClients & tasks) should not cache connections or maybe cache them for very short periods of time. Clients should set up & tear down connections to the servers everytime they need to contact the servers (including the heartbeats). If connection is cached, then reuse the existing connection for a few subsequent transactions until the connection expires. The heartbeat interval should be more so that many more clients (order of  tens of thousands) can be accomodated within 1 heartbeat interval.

I think that we should just bite the bullet and move to 1.5's generics, enums, and richer library. I do wish that Sun would open source Java so that more platforms could have current jdks.

> The current TextInputFormat readLine method calls break on either a single '\r' or '\n' character.  This causes windows formatted text files '\r' '\n' to leave a trailing '\n' character and the next time the readLine method is called on the same input stream it returns a blank string.  The patch attached corrects this issue by looking for either single or double character line endings and positions the input stream to the next line.  It correctly handles windows, mac, and unix line endings.

There are not many threads in the system. It is one per server (in the current version of hadoop, it is a single digit number, maybe, 2 or 3). If connection life is 1 sec and if the thread's life is same as the life of the connection, then a thread is destroyed/created ~once/second per server. I really wanted to avoid creating/destroying threads that often.

> Servers and clients (client include datanodes, tasktrackers, DFSClients & tasks) should not cache connections or maybe cache them for very short periods of time. Clients should set up & tear down connections to the servers everytime they need to contact the servers (including the heartbeats). If connection is cached, then reuse the existing connection for a few subsequent transactions until the connection expires. The heartbeat interval should be more so that many more clients (order of  tens of thousands) can be accomodated within 1 heartbeat interval.

Vetle Roeim commented on HADOOP-466:
------------------------------------

How does _not_ having HADOOP_IDENT_STRING prevent running multiple instances on the same conf dir as different users? The configuration contains port numbers, and the Hadoop daemons won't start if there are already daemons bound to those ports.

In any case, running with separate config directories has been greatly simplified with the introduction of the --config command line parameter.

> Configuration directories can be specified by either setting HADOOP_CONF_DIR or using the --config command line option. However, the hadoop-daemon.sh script will not start the daemons unless the PID directory is separate for each configuration.
> The issue is that the code for generating PID filenames is not dependent on the configuration directory. While the PID directory can be changed in hadoop-env.sh, it seems a little unnecessary to have this restriction.

+1 for Owen's arguments.

Although at the code level, anything that is done to the input record  
can be put either into an InputFormat or into a Mapper, it seems to be  
quite important to force a clear separation these concepts.
A more naive user may prefer to be completely ignorant about the notion  
of InputFormat.

Defining interfaces that a easy to understand is more than just  
syntactic sugar, and usability should not be sacrificed to  
orthogonality.

Arun C Murthy updated HADOOP-54:
--------------------------------

    Attachment: SequenceFile20060824.tgz

Here's the latest patch incorporating Owen's quibble about the enum, also I have added a -rwonly option to TestSequenceFile.java and attached results of just read/write tests on seq3 and seq4.

> SequenceFile will optionally compress individual values.  But both compression and performance would be much better if sequences of keys and values are compressed together.  Sync marks should only be placed between blocks.  This will require some changes to MapFile too, so that all file positions stored there are the positions of blocks, not entries within blocks.  Probably this can be accomplished by adding a getBlockStartPosition() method to SequenceFile.Writer.

Doug Cook commented on HADOOP-406:
----------------------------------

This issue bit me as well, and it took me some time to unravel the mystery. It would be nice to fix it in the main distribution!

I'm agnostic about what the long-term "right" solution is, but Chris's patch certainly works for me. (Thanks, Chris!)

> Child JVM's don't have access to logging config system properties. When the child JVM gets launched, it doesn't inherit the Java system properties hadoop.log.dir and hadoop.log.file (which are actually based on the Bash environment variables $HADOOP_LOG_DIR and $HADOOP_LOGFILE). This means that you get no log messages from the actual map/reduce tasks that are executing.

> We see several ways to solve this problem. First retrieve the properties "hadoop.log.dir" and "hadoop.log.file" from the mother JVM and then pass them to the child JVM as within the args parameter.
> Second would be to  access the environment variables "$HADOOP_LOG_DIR" and "$HADOOP_LOGFILE" using System.getEnv (java 1.5).
> Third there would be a more general solution. Taskrunner would resolve any environment variables it found in "mapred.child.java.opts" by lookup the value using System.getEnv().
> Eg:
> unix:
> export MAX_MEMORY = 200
> hadoop-site.xml:
> <name>mapred.child.java.opts</name>
> <value>-Xmx${MAX_MEMORY}</value>

Sameer Paranjpye commented on HADOOP-306:
-----------------------------------------

I wonder if it makes sense to wait for 100% of blocks to be available. It's possible  for data to go missing because of failed drives, nodes, racks... When some data goes missing it's usually the case that some other (co-located) data becomes under-replicated and the Namenode ought to start replicating the under replicated data. Why do we want safe mode?

* To prevent replication thrash when the Namenode starts
* To enable administrators to make the file system read only for diagnosis and debugging

Neither of these require that 100% of blocks are present. Maybe we should have a slightly lower threshold for blocks or storage ids.

> This is a proposal to improve DFS cluster startup process.
> The data node startup procedures were described and implemented in HADOOP-124.
> I'm trying to extend them to the name node here.
> The main idea is to introduce safe mode, which can be entered manually for administration
> purposes, or automatically when a configurable threshold of active data nodes is breached,
> or at startup when the node stays in safe mode until the minimal limit of active
> nodes is reached.
> This are high level requirements intended to improve the name node and cluster reliability.
>     = The name node safe mode means that the name node is not changing the state of the
>        file system. Meta data is read-only, and block replication / removal is not taking place.
>     = In safe mode the name node accepts data node registrations and
>        processes their block reports.
>     = The name node always starts in safe mode and stays safe until the majority
>         (a configurable parameter: safemode.threshold) of data nodes (or blocks?)
>         is reported.
>     = The name node can also fall into safe mode when the number of non-active
>         (heartbeats stopped coming in) data nodes becomes critical.
>     = The startup "silent period", when the name node is in safe mode and is
>         not issuing any block requests to the data nodes, is initially set to a
>         configurable value safemode.timeout.increment. By the end of the timeout
>         the name node checks the safemode.threshold and decides whether to switch
>         to the normal mode or to stay in safe. If the normal mode criteria is not
>         met, then the silent period is extended by incrementing the safemode timeout.
>     = The name node stays in safe mode not longer than a configurable value of
>         safemode.timeout.max, in which case it logs missing data nodes and shuts
>         itself down.
>     = When the name node switches to normal mode it checks whether all required
>         data nodes have actually registered, based on the list of active data storages
>         from the last session. Then it logs missing nodes, if any, and starts
>         replicating and/or deleting blocks as required.
>     = A historical list of data storages (nodes) ever registered with the cluster is
>         persistently stored in the image and log files. The list is used in two ways:
>         a) at startup to verify whether all nodes have registered, and to report
>         missing nodes;
>         b) at runtime if a data node registers with a new storage id the
>         name node verifies that no new blocks are reported from that storage,
>         which would prevent us from accidentally connecting data nodes from a
>         different cluster.
>     = The name node should have an option to run in safe mode. Starting with
>         that option would mean it never leaves safe mode.
>         This is useful for testing the cluster.
>     = Data nodes that can not connect to the name node for a long time (configurable)
>         should shut down themselves.

Dennis Kubes updated HADOOP-473:
--------------------------------

    Attachment: text-input-format2.patch

Sorry it took me so long.  I had the patch a couple of days ago I was just in the middle of testing.  Here is an updated patch that removes the read ahead and fixes the same problem of line endings in the getRecordReader method of TextInputFormat.  This has been lightly tested.

> The current TextInputFormat readLine method calls break on either a single '\r' or '\n' character.  This causes windows formatted text files '\r' '\n' to leave a trailing '\n' character and the next time the readLine method is called on the same input stream it returns a blank string.  The patch attached corrects this issue by looking for either single or double character line endings and positions the input stream to the next line.  It correctly handles windows, mac, and unix line endings.

> RFC: Efficient file caching 
> (on Hadoop Task nodes, for benefit of MapReduce Tasks)
> ------------------------------------------------------
> We will start implementing this soon. Please provide feedback and improvements to this plan.
> The header "Options:" indicates places where simple choices must be made.
> Problem:
> -------
> o MapReduce tasks require access to additional out-of-band data ("dictionaries")
> This out-of-band data is:
> o in addition to the map/reduce inputs.
> o large (1GB+)
> o broadcast (same data is required on all the Task nodes)
> o changes "infrequently", in particular:
> oo it is always constant for all the Tasks in a Job. 
> oo it is often constant for a month at a time 
> oo it may be shared across team members
> o sometimes used by pure-Java MapReduce programs
> o sometimes used by non-Java MapReduce programs (using Hadoop-Streaming)
> o (future) used by programs that use HDFS and Task-trackers but not MapReduce.
> Existing Solutions to the problem:
> ---------------------------------
> These solutions are not good enough. The present proposal is to do Sol 1 with caching.
> Sol 1: Pure Hadoop: package the out-of-band data in the MapReduce Job jar file.
> Sol 2: Non  Hadoop: for each task node run rsync from single source for data.
> Sol 3: Non  Hadoop: use BitTorrent, etc.
> Sol.1 is correct but slow for many reasons:
>  The Job submitter must recreate a large jar(tar) file for every Job.
>   (The jar contains both changing programs and stable dictionaries)
>  The large Jar file must be propagated from the client to HDFS with 
>  a large replication factor. 
>  At the beginning of every Task, the Task tracker gets the job jar from HDFS 
>  and unjars it in the working directory. This can dominate task execution time.
>  
> Sol.2 has nice properties but also some problems.
>  It does not scale well with large clusters (many concurrent rsync read requests i.e. single-source broadcast)
>  It assumes that Hadoop users can upload data using rsync to the cluster nodes. As a policy, this is not allowed.
>  It requires rsync.
>  
> Sol.3 alleviates the rsync scalability problems but 
>       It is a dependency on an external system. 
>       We want something simpler and more tightly integrated with Hadoop.
>       
> Staging (uploading) out-of-band data:
> ------------------------------------
> The out-of-band data will often originate on the local filesystem of a user machine 
>  (i.e. a MapReduce job submitter)
> Nevertheless it makes sense to use HDFS to store the original out-of-band data because:
> o HDFS has (wide) replication. This enables scalable broadcast later.
> o HDFS is an available channel to move data from clients to all task machines.
> o HDFS is convenient as a shared location among Hadoop team members.
> Accessing (downloading) out-of-band data:
> ----------------------------------------
> The non-Java MapReduce programs do not have or want[1] APIs for HDFS.
> Instead these programs just want to access out-of-band data as 
>  local files at predefined paths.
> ([1] Existing programs should be reusable with no changes. 
>  This is often possible bec. communication is over stdin/stdout.)
> Job's jar file as a special case:
> --------------------------------
> One use case is to allow users to make the job jar itself cachable.
> This is only useful in cases where NOTHING changes when a job is resubmitted
>  (no MapRed code changes and no changes in shipped data)
> This situation might occur with an 'extractor' job (gets data from an external source: like Nutch crawler)
> Currently the Hadoop mapred-jar mechanism works in this way:
>  the job jar data is unjarred in the "working directory" of the Task 
>  the jar contains both MapRed java code (added to classpath)
> Cache synchronization:
> ---------------------
> The efficient implementation of the out-of-band data distribution
> is mostly a cache synchronization problem.
> A list of the various aspects where choices must be made follows.
> Cache key:
> ---------
> How do you test that the cached copy is out-of-date?
> Options: 
> 1. the archive/file timestamp 
> 2. the MD5 of the archive/file content
> Comparing source and destination Timestamps is problematic bec. it assumes synchronized clocks.
> Also there is no last-modif metadata in HDFS (for good reasons, like scalability of metadata ops)
> Timestamps stored with the source ('last-propagate-time') do 
>  not require synchronized clocks, only locally monotonic time. 
> (and the worse which can happen at daylight-savings switch is a missed update or an extra-update)
> The cache code could store a copy of the local timestamp 
> in the same way that it caches the value of the content hash along with the source data.
>  
> Cachable unit:
> -------------
> Options: individual files or archives or both.
> Note:
> At the API level, directories will be processed recursively 
> (and the local FS directories will parallel HDFS directories)
> So bulk operations are always possible using directories.
> The question here is whether to handle archives as an additional bulk mechanism.
> Archives are special because:
> o unarchiving occurs transparently as part of the cache sync
> o The cache key is computed on the archive and preserved although 
>   the archive itself is not preserved.
> Supported archive format will be: tar (maybe tgz or compressed jar)
> Archive detection test: by filename extension ".tar" or ".jar"
> Suppose we don't handle archives as special files:
> Pros:
>  o less code, no discussion about which archive formats are supported
>  o fine for large dictionary files. And when files are not large, user may as well
>    put them in the Job jar as usual.
>  o user code could always check and unarchive specific cached files
>    (as a side-effect of MapRed task initialization)
> Cons:
>  o handling small files may be inefficient 
>   (multiple HDFS operations, multiple hash computation, 
>    one 'metadata' hash file along with each small file)
>  o It will not be possible to handle the Job's jar file as a special case of caching 
> Cache isolation: 
> ---------------
> In some cases it may be a problem if the cached HDFS files are updated while a Job is in progress:
> The file may become unavailable for a short period of time and some tasks fail.
> The file may change (atomically) and different tasks use a different version.
> This isolation problem is not addressed in this proposal.
> Standard solutions to the isolation problem are:
> o Assume that Jobs and interfering cache updates won't occur concurrently.
> o Put a version number in the HDFS file paths and refer to a hard-coded version in the Job code.
> o Before running the MapRed job, run a non-distributed application that tests
>   what is the latest available version of the out-of-band data. 
>   Then make this version available to the MapRed job.
>   Two ways to do this. 
>   o either set a job property just-in-time:
>     addCachePathPair("/mydata/v1234/", "localcache/mydata_latest"); 
>     (see Job Configuration for meaning of this)
>   o or publish the decision as an HDFS file containing the version.
>     then rely on user code to read the version, and manually populate the cache:
>     Cache.syncCache("/hdfs/path/fileordir", "relative/local/fileordir");
>     (see MapReduce API for meaning of this)
> Cache synchronization stages:
> ----------------------------
> There are two stages: Client-to-HDFS and HDFS-to-TaskTracker
> o Client-to-HDFS stage.
> Options: A simple option is to not do anything here, i.e. rely on the user.
> This is a reasonable option given previous remarks on the role of HDFS:
>  HDFS is a staging/publishing area and a natural shared location.
> In particular this means that the system need not track 
> where the client files come from.
> o HDFS-to-TaskTracker:
> Client-to-HDFS synchronization (if done at all) should happen before this.
> Then HDFS-to-TaskTracker synchronization must happen right before 
> the data is needed on a node.
> MapReduce cache API:
> -------------------
> Options:
> 1. No change in MapReduce framework code:
> require the user to put this logic in map() (or reduce) function:
>  in MyMapper constructor (or in map() on first record) user is asked to add:
>  
>     Cache.syncCache("/hdfs/path/fileordir", "relative/local/fileordir");
>     Cache.syncCache("..."); //etc.
>   
> -----
> 2. Put this logic in MapReduce framework and use Job properties to
>    communicate the list of pairs (hdfs path; local path)
>  
> Directories are processed recursively.
> If archives are treated specially then they are unarchived on destination.
>  
> MapReduce Job Configuration:
> ---------------------------
> Options:
> with No change in MapReduce framework code (see above)
>  no special Job configuration: 
>    it is up to the MapRed writer to configure and run the cache operations.
> ---
> with Logic in MapReduce framework (see above)
>  some simple Job configuration
> JobConf.addCachePathPair(String, String)
> JobConf.addCachePathPair("/hdfs/path/fileordir", "relative/local/fileordir");

> RFC: Efficient file caching 
> (on Hadoop Task nodes, for benefit of MapReduce Tasks)
> ------------------------------------------------------
> We will start implementing this soon. Please provide feedback and improvements to this plan.
> The header "Options:" indicates places where simple choices must be made.
> Problem:
> -------
> o MapReduce tasks require access to additional out-of-band data ("dictionaries")
> This out-of-band data is:
> o in addition to the map/reduce inputs.
> o large (1GB+)
> o broadcast (same data is required on all the Task nodes)
> o changes "infrequently", in particular:
> oo it is always constant for all the Tasks in a Job. 
> oo it is often constant for a month at a time 
> oo it may be shared across team members
> o sometimes used by pure-Java MapReduce programs
> o sometimes used by non-Java MapReduce programs (using Hadoop-Streaming)
> o (future) used by programs that use HDFS and Task-trackers but not MapReduce.
> Existing Solutions to the problem:
> ---------------------------------
> These solutions are not good enough. The present proposal is to do Sol 1 with caching.
> Sol 1: Pure Hadoop: package the out-of-band data in the MapReduce Job jar file.
> Sol 2: Non  Hadoop: for each task node run rsync from single source for data.
> Sol 3: Non  Hadoop: use BitTorrent, etc.
> Sol.1 is correct but slow for many reasons:
>  The Job submitter must recreate a large jar(tar) file for every Job.
>   (The jar contains both changing programs and stable dictionaries)
>  The large Jar file must be propagated from the client to HDFS with 
>  a large replication factor. 
>  At the beginning of every Task, the Task tracker gets the job jar from HDFS 
>  and unjars it in the working directory. This can dominate task execution time.
>  
> Sol.2 has nice properties but also some problems.
>  It does not scale well with large clusters (many concurrent rsync read requests i.e. single-source broadcast)
>  It assumes that Hadoop users can upload data using rsync to the cluster nodes. As a policy, this is not allowed.
>  It requires rsync.
>  
> Sol.3 alleviates the rsync scalability problems but 
>       It is a dependency on an external system. 
>       We want something simpler and more tightly integrated with Hadoop.
>       
> Staging (uploading) out-of-band data:
> ------------------------------------
> The out-of-band data will often originate on the local filesystem of a user machine 
>  (i.e. a MapReduce job submitter)
> Nevertheless it makes sense to use HDFS to store the original out-of-band data because:
> o HDFS has (wide) replication. This enables scalable broadcast later.
> o HDFS is an available channel to move data from clients to all task machines.
> o HDFS is convenient as a shared location among Hadoop team members.
> Accessing (downloading) out-of-band data:
> ----------------------------------------
> The non-Java MapReduce programs do not have or want[1] APIs for HDFS.
> Instead these programs just want to access out-of-band data as 
>  local files at predefined paths.
> ([1] Existing programs should be reusable with no changes. 
>  This is often possible bec. communication is over stdin/stdout.)
> Job's jar file as a special case:
> --------------------------------
> One use case is to allow users to make the job jar itself cachable.
> This is only useful in cases where NOTHING changes when a job is resubmitted
>  (no MapRed code changes and no changes in shipped data)
> This situation might occur with an 'extractor' job (gets data from an external source: like Nutch crawler)
> Currently the Hadoop mapred-jar mechanism works in this way:
>  the job jar data is unjarred in the "working directory" of the Task 
>  the jar contains both MapRed java code (added to classpath)
> Cache synchronization:
> ---------------------
> The efficient implementation of the out-of-band data distribution
> is mostly a cache synchronization problem.
> A list of the various aspects where choices must be made follows.
> Cache key:
> ---------
> How do you test that the cached copy is out-of-date?
> Options: 
> 1. the archive/file timestamp 
> 2. the MD5 of the archive/file content
> Comparing source and destination Timestamps is problematic bec. it assumes synchronized clocks.
> Also there is no last-modif metadata in HDFS (for good reasons, like scalability of metadata ops)
> Timestamps stored with the source ('last-propagate-time') do 
>  not require synchronized clocks, only locally monotonic time. 
> (and the worse which can happen at daylight-savings switch is a missed update or an extra-update)
> The cache code could store a copy of the local timestamp 
> in the same way that it caches the value of the content hash along with the source data.
>  
> Cachable unit:
> -------------
> Options: individual files or archives or both.
> Note:
> At the API level, directories will be processed recursively 
> (and the local FS directories will parallel HDFS directories)
> So bulk operations are always possible using directories.
> The question here is whether to handle archives as an additional bulk mechanism.
> Archives are special because:
> o unarchiving occurs transparently as part of the cache sync
> o The cache key is computed on the archive and preserved although 
>   the archive itself is not preserved.
> Supported archive format will be: tar (maybe tgz or compressed jar)
> Archive detection test: by filename extension ".tar" or ".jar"
> Suppose we don't handle archives as special files:
> Pros:
>  o less code, no discussion about which archive formats are supported
>  o fine for large dictionary files. And when files are not large, user may as well
>    put them in the Job jar as usual.
>  o user code could always check and unarchive specific cached files
>    (as a side-effect of MapRed task initialization)
> Cons:
>  o handling small files may be inefficient 
>   (multiple HDFS operations, multiple hash computation, 
>    one 'metadata' hash file along with each small file)
>  o It will not be possible to handle the Job's jar file as a special case of caching 
> Cache isolation: 
> ---------------
> In some cases it may be a problem if the cached HDFS files are updated while a Job is in progress:
> The file may become unavailable for a short period of time and some tasks fail.
> The file may change (atomically) and different tasks use a different version.
> This isolation problem is not addressed in this proposal.
> Standard solutions to the isolation problem are:
> o Assume that Jobs and interfering cache updates won't occur concurrently.
> o Put a version number in the HDFS file paths and refer to a hard-coded version in the Job code.
> o Before running the MapRed job, run a non-distributed application that tests
>   what is the latest available version of the out-of-band data. 
>   Then make this version available to the MapRed job.
>   Two ways to do this. 
>   o either set a job property just-in-time:
>     addCachePathPair("/mydata/v1234/", "localcache/mydata_latest"); 
>     (see Job Configuration for meaning of this)
>   o or publish the decision as an HDFS file containing the version.
>     then rely on user code to read the version, and manually populate the cache:
>     Cache.syncCache("/hdfs/path/fileordir", "relative/local/fileordir");
>     (see MapReduce API for meaning of this)
> Cache synchronization stages:
> ----------------------------
> There are two stages: Client-to-HDFS and HDFS-to-TaskTracker
> o Client-to-HDFS stage.
> Options: A simple option is to not do anything here, i.e. rely on the user.
> This is a reasonable option given previous remarks on the role of HDFS:
>  HDFS is a staging/publishing area and a natural shared location.
> In particular this means that the system need not track 
> where the client files come from.
> o HDFS-to-TaskTracker:
> Client-to-HDFS synchronization (if done at all) should happen before this.
> Then HDFS-to-TaskTracker synchronization must happen right before 
> the data is needed on a node.
> MapReduce cache API:
> -------------------
> Options:
> 1. No change in MapReduce framework code:
> require the user to put this logic in map() (or reduce) function:
>  in MyMapper constructor (or in map() on first record) user is asked to add:
>  
>     Cache.syncCache("/hdfs/path/fileordir", "relative/local/fileordir");
>     Cache.syncCache("..."); //etc.
>   
> -----
> 2. Put this logic in MapReduce framework and use Job properties to
>    communicate the list of pairs (hdfs path; local path)
>  
> Directories are processed recursively.
> If archives are treated specially then they are unarchived on destination.
>  
> MapReduce Job Configuration:
> ---------------------------
> Options:
> with No change in MapReduce framework code (see above)
>  no special Job configuration: 
>    it is up to the MapRed writer to configure and run the cache operations.
> ---
> with Logic in MapReduce framework (see above)
>  some simple Job configuration
> JobConf.addCachePathPair(String, String)
> JobConf.addCachePathPair("/hdfs/path/fileordir", "relative/local/fileordir");

The value iterator to reduce function should be clonable
--------------------------------------------------------

                 Key: HADOOP-475
                 URL: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-475
             Project: Hadoop
          Issue Type: New Feature
            Reporter: Runping Qi



In the current framework, when the user implements the reduce method of Reducer class, 
the user can only iterate through the value iterator once. 
This makes it hard for the user to perform join-like operations with in the reduce method. 
To address problem, one approach is to make the input value iterator clonable. Then the user can iterate the values in different ways.
If the iterator can be reset, then the user can perform nested iterations over the data, thus 
carry out join-likeoperations.

The user code in reduce method would be something like:

                  iterator1 = values.clone();
                  iterator2 = values.clone();
                 while (iterator1.hasNext()) {
                      val1 = iterator1.next();
                      iterator2.reset();
                      while (iterator2.hasNext()) {
                           val2 = iterator.next();
                           do something vased on val1 and val2
                           .......................
                      }
                 }

One possible optimization is that if the values are sorted based on a secondary key, 
the reset function can take a secondary key as an argument and reset the iterator to the begining
position of the secondary key. It will be very helpful if there is a utility that returns a list of iterators,
one per secondary key value, from the given iterator:

                          TreeMap getIteratorsBasedOnSecondaryKey(iterator);

Each entry in the returned map object is a pair of <secondary key, iterator for the values with the same secondary key>.

arkady borkovsky commented on HADOOP-472:
-----------------------------------------

Yoram suggested that this issue is split into several ones.

So let's keep this one for what it's heading says:

"Hadoop Streaming should not crash".

That is, Streaming client (hadoop-streaming.jar) should not complete with a stack trace.  It should catch all exceptions and provide a human readable error message.
Common exceptions caused by common user mistakes should be explained by these messages.  

Rationalization:
When a user tries to execute a Perl script and sees a Java stack trace, she immediately assumes that the tools is broken.  
I have obsereved this ssepcifically trying to get people to use Streaming.

Unlike some other Hadoop components that are supposed to be used Java code, Streaming is a user facing application.  This imposes different requirements on exception handling.

Streaming should check for correctness of the task
--------------------------------------------------

            Reporter: arkady borkovsky


Currently, if anythin is wrong with streaming job, it dies without any explanation.

Before creating and running actual MapReduce job, Streaming should check if:

-- the executables (or scripts) for -mapper and -reducer are available and have right permissions
-- the input fragments exist

Streaming should execute Unix commands and scripts in well known languages without user specifying the path
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                 Key: HADOOP-477
                 URL: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-477
             Project: Hadoop
          Issue Type: Bug
          Components: contrib/streaming
            Reporter: arkady borkovsky



If the executables for -mapper or -reducer are well-known (grep, cat, awk), Streaming should make sure that the executable is found.
If a script  for -mapper or -reducer are in a well-known language (.pl, .py), Streaming should  execute it  with the correct language processor.

Reason:
many jobs get started from machines with a different environment from that on the cluster.  
On another hand, different clusters may have different environments.  
Also, a user may have no access to the cluster machines.
Because of this, a user may be unable to specify correct paths for standard commands, and correct language processors for scripts.

Implementation:
Stream may tailr the commands by prepending the path, or the name of language processor.  
Another solution is to make sure that the commands are executed in a "meaningful" environment (with good $PATH, and other variables Unix users are accustomed to count upon).

Once again, Streaming is user facing tool -- it is not a library or a hackable example that the users are to modify for their needs.  So it should work out of the box.

            Reporter: arkady borkovsky


Streaming should collect stderr output of -mapper and - reduces steps and put it into the place accessible by the user.
E.g. it can go into
/user/name/stderr/job-id/task-id.txt

This is indpendent from MapReduce framework catching stderr of "normal" Java MapReduce jobs.  
A Java programmer has many ways to handle the problem on her own (at least until the framework matures and provides more help).
Unlike her, a user of Streaming has no access to files.  
Therefore it is an immediate requirement for Streaming to provide its own support for delivering this critical data to the user.

Streaming should produce a short per-job log in a persistent location.

The log should include (at least, but not limited to):
-- the command line that hadoop-streaming is executing 
-- the list of matching input fragments
-- the actual command lines used by the framework for -mapper and for -reducer
-- log about all copied files
-- the name of the output HDFS directory
-- start and end time of the job
-- location of stderr logs and other output.

Konstantin Shvachko commented on HADOOP-306:
--------------------------------------------

Thanks for the comments. Based on what you say I can define the threshold constraint as:
  **   the percentage of blocks that meet minimal replication requirement (defined by dfs.safemode.replication)
I think this would be flexible enough.
And I'll keep the dfs.datanode.startupMsec that defines the startup period during which replications are not allowed.
So the name node will stay in safe mode at start up until the threshold is reached AND the startup period hasn't expired.

> This is a proposal to improve DFS cluster startup process.
> The data node startup procedures were described and implemented in HADOOP-124.
> I'm trying to extend them to the name node here.
> The main idea is to introduce safe mode, which can be entered manually for administration
> purposes, or automatically when a configurable threshold of active data nodes is breached,
> or at startup when the node stays in safe mode until the minimal limit of active
> nodes is reached.
> This are high level requirements intended to improve the name node and cluster reliability.
>     = The name node safe mode means that the name node is not changing the state of the
>        file system. Meta data is read-only, and block replication / removal is not taking place.
>     = In safe mode the name node accepts data node registrations and
>        processes their block reports.
>     = The name node always starts in safe mode and stays safe until the majority
>         (a configurable parameter: safemode.threshold) of data nodes (or blocks?)
>         is reported.
>     = The name node can also fall into safe mode when the number of non-active
>         (heartbeats stopped coming in) data nodes becomes critical.
>     = The startup "silent period", when the name node is in safe mode and is
>         not issuing any block requests to the data nodes, is initially set to a
>         configurable value safemode.timeout.increment. By the end of the timeout
>         the name node checks the safemode.threshold and decides whether to switch
>         to the normal mode or to stay in safe. If the normal mode criteria is not
>         met, then the silent period is extended by incrementing the safemode timeout.
>     = The name node stays in safe mode not longer than a configurable value of
>         safemode.timeout.max, in which case it logs missing data nodes and shuts
>         itself down.
>     = When the name node switches to normal mode it checks whether all required
>         data nodes have actually registered, based on the list of active data storages
>         from the last session. Then it logs missing nodes, if any, and starts
>         replicating and/or deleting blocks as required.
>     = A historical list of data storages (nodes) ever registered with the cluster is
>         persistently stored in the image and log files. The list is used in two ways:
>         a) at startup to verify whether all nodes have registered, and to report
>         missing nodes;
>         b) at runtime if a data node registers with a new storage id the
>         name node verifies that no new blocks are reported from that storage,
>         which would prevent us from accidentally connecting data nodes from a
>         different cluster.
>     = The name node should have an option to run in safe mode. Starting with
>         that option would mean it never leaves safe mode.
>         This is useful for testing the cluster.
>     = Data nodes that can not connect to the name node for a long time (configurable)
>         should shut down themselves.

It should be possible to specify names of such files  to hadoop-streaming command so that once a task is done these files are copied into HDFS to a task-specific location.
E.g.
/user/name/side-output/job-ib/filename.task-id.attempt-id

                 URL: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-481
             Project: Hadoop
          Issue Type: Improvement

    Affects Versions: 0.6.0
            Reporter: Milind Bhandarkar
         Assigned To: Milind Bhandarkar
            Priority: Minor
             Fix For: 0.6.0


Currently hadoop reports metrics such as input bytes, input records, etc on per-task basis. Accurate aggregation of these metrics is required at the job-level and reporting should be done on a per-job basis.

Arun C Murthy updated HADOOP-483:
---------------------------------

    Attachment: libhdfs.patch

Here's a patch with necessary changes to hdfs.h and a Doxyfile for documention - I haven't attached the actual documentation produced; if need be I can do that too and submit a new patch.

Also I have fixed some path issues for common utils (chmod, rm etc.) in the Makefile and in DFSCIOTest.java. I have also added a 'docs' target in the Makefile to generate the Doxygen documentation.

Arun C Murthy commented on HADOOP-483:
--------------------------------------

I have also written up a wiki page on libhdfs: http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-hadoop/LibHDFS - appreciate any feedback. 

Once the Doxygen generated docs are available online (after the patch is committed) I'll go ahead fix links in the wiki for all the apis.

Owen O'Malley updated HADOOP-419:
---------------------------------

    Attachment: classloader.patch

This patch, pulls the classloader stuff out of JobConf and puts it into ReflectionUtils. It also fixes this bug by using the default class loader if there isn't a thread specific class loader.

Sameer Paranjpye commented on HADOOP-312:
-----------------------------------------

> There are not many threads in the system.

Perhaps, but thread creation is quite cheap. I see two reasons for not keeping threads around.

a) The code will be simpler if all objects associated with a server (connection and thread in this case) are created/destroyed together. 
b) The point of not caching connections is to avoid lingering unused resources, that applies to threads as much as it does to connections. If there is a use case where connections are created/destroyed once/second/server then the appropriate course to avoid this thrash would be to enable connection caching, no?

> Servers and clients (client include datanodes, tasktrackers, DFSClients & tasks) should not cache connections or maybe cache them for very short periods of time. Clients should set up & tear down connections to the servers everytime they need to contact the servers (including the heartbeats). If connection is cached, then reuse the existing connection for a few subsequent transactions until the connection expires. The heartbeat interval should be more so that many more clients (order of  tens of thousands) can be accomodated within 1 heartbeat interval.

Yoram Arnon commented on HADOOP-466:
------------------------------------

if HADOOP_IDENT_STRING isn't specified explicitly, it defaults to $USER.
pid files  that incorporate HADOOP_IDENT_STRING will then have different names when invoked by different users, negating their effect as uniquely identifying a process using that conf dir.
slaves bind to the configured port, but if that fails they scan forward up to 10 ports to find a port to bind, so they'll start just fine, connect the the same master and presto, we have two slaves on the same machine running as different users.

I always use the --config parameter, so yes, I'm not overly concerned, but I've seen this happen.

It's not a big deal, but as long as you're going to the trouble of hashing the conf dir into the file names, I thought it might be another improvement.

> Configuration directories can be specified by either setting HADOOP_CONF_DIR or using the --config command line option. However, the hadoop-daemon.sh script will not start the daemons unless the PID directory is separate for each configuration.
> The issue is that the code for generating PID filenames is not dependent on the configuration directory. While the PID directory can be changed in hadoop-env.sh, it seems a little unnecessary to have this restriction.

Doug Cutting commented on HADOOP-441:
-------------------------------------

Another option is to live without 'reset':

public interface CompressionCodec extends Configurable {
  DataOutputStream getDeflater(OutputStream out);
  DataInputStream getInflater(InputStream in);
  String getDefaultExtension(); 
} 

A new output stream can be created for each compressed block.  With block compression, this should not be so frequent that performance is significantly affected.  If compressor setup time is significant, then codec could pool compressors as an optimization.  When a stream is closed then the compressor can be reset and returned to a pool for re-use.  Simpler yet, the codec could save the last stream closed, and, if a new call has the same parameters, reset and return the entire stream.  This way there would be no new object allocation per block.

> SequenceFiles should support 'custom compressors' which can be specified by the user on creation of the file. 
> Readily available packages for gzip and zip (java.util.zip) are among obvious choices to support. Of course there will be hooks so that other compressors can be added in future as long as there is a way to construct (input/output) streams on top of the compressor/decompressor.
> The 'classname' of the 'custom compressor/decompressor' could be stored in the header of the SequenceFile which can then be used by SequenceFile.Reader to figure out the appropriate 'decompressor'. Thus I propose we add constructors to SequenceFile.Writer which take in the 'classname' of the compressor's input/output stream classes (e.g. DeflaterOutputStream/InflaterInputStream or GZIPOutputStream/GZIPInputStream), which acts as the hook for future compressors/decompressors.

Doug Cutting commented on HADOOP-474:
-------------------------------------

+1, with a few questions:

Do we need io.compression.codecs if the codecs provide extensions?  If so, then what's the point of having the codec's provide extensions?

Should the output property be instead named mapred.text.output.compression.codec?  In other words, will we use this same property to name the codecs for other output formats, or is this property for text files alone (in which case it should have 'text' in its name)?

> I'd like TextInputFomat and TextOutputFormat to automatically compress and uncompress text files when they are read and written. Furthermore, I'd like to be able to use custom compressors as defined in HADOOP-441. Therefore, I propose:
> Adding a map of compression codecs in the server config files:
> io.compression.codecs = "<suffix>=<codec class>,..."
> so the default would be something like:
> <property>
>   <name>io.compression.codecs</name>
>   <value>.gz=org.apache.hadoop.io.GZipCodec,.Z=org.apache.hadoop.io.ZipCodec</value>
>   <description>A list of file suffixes and the codecs for them.</description>
> </property>
> note that the suffix can include multiple "." so you could support suffixes like ".tar.gz", but they are just treated as literals against the end of the filename.
> If the TextInputFormat is dealing with such a file, it:
>   1. makes a single split
>   2. decompresses automatically
> On the output side, if mapred.output.compress is true, then TextOutputFormat would use a new property mapred.output.compression.codec that would define the codec to use to compress the outputs,  defaulting to gzip.

------------------------------------

the timeout should start *after* the threshold is reached.
If namenode is started long before datanodes, then as soon as the threshold is reached superfluous replications will occur.
the timeout should be short, I'd say less than a minute, and should start as soon as the data/nodes threshold is reached, to allow stragglers to connect and report

> This is a proposal to improve DFS cluster startup process.
> The data node startup procedures were described and implemented in HADOOP-124.
> I'm trying to extend them to the name node here.
> The main idea is to introduce safe mode, which can be entered manually for administration
> purposes, or automatically when a configurable threshold of active data nodes is breached,
> or at startup when the node stays in safe mode until the minimal limit of active
> nodes is reached.
> This are high level requirements intended to improve the name node and cluster reliability.
>     = The name node safe mode means that the name node is not changing the state of the
>        file system. Meta data is read-only, and block replication / removal is not taking place.
>     = In safe mode the name node accepts data node registrations and
>        processes their block reports.
>     = The name node always starts in safe mode and stays safe until the majority
>         (a configurable parameter: safemode.threshold) of data nodes (or blocks?)
>         is reported.
>     = The name node can also fall into safe mode when the number of non-active
>         (heartbeats stopped coming in) data nodes becomes critical.
>     = The startup "silent period", when the name node is in safe mode and is
>         not issuing any block requests to the data nodes, is initially set to a
>         configurable value safemode.timeout.increment. By the end of the timeout
>         the name node checks the safemode.threshold and decides whether to switch
>         to the normal mode or to stay in safe. If the normal mode criteria is not
>         met, then the silent period is extended by incrementing the safemode timeout.
>     = The name node stays in safe mode not longer than a configurable value of
>         safemode.timeout.max, in which case it logs missing data nodes and shuts
>         itself down.
>     = When the name node switches to normal mode it checks whether all required
>         data nodes have actually registered, based on the list of active data storages
>         from the last session. Then it logs missing nodes, if any, and starts
>         replicating and/or deleting blocks as required.
>     = A historical list of data storages (nodes) ever registered with the cluster is
>         persistently stored in the image and log files. The list is used in two ways:
>         a) at startup to verify whether all nodes have registered, and to report
>         missing nodes;
>         b) at runtime if a data node registers with a new storage id the
>         name node verifies that no new blocks are reported from that storage,
>         which would prevent us from accidentally connecting data nodes from a
>         different cluster.
>     = The name node should have an option to run in safe mode. Starting with
>         that option would mean it never leaves safe mode.
>         This is useful for testing the cluster.
>     = Data nodes that can not connect to the name node for a long time (configurable)
>         should shut down themselves.

> The current TextInputFormat readLine method calls break on either a single '\r' or '\n' character.  This causes windows formatted text files '\r' '\n' to leave a trailing '\n' character and the next time the readLine method is called on the same input stream it returns a blank string.  The patch attached corrects this issue by looking for either single or double character line endings and positions the input stream to the next line.  It correctly handles windows, mac, and unix line endings.

Owen O'Malley commented on HADOOP-474:
--------------------------------------

> Do we need io.compression.codecs if the codecs provide extensions? If so, then what's the 
> point of having the codec's provide extensions?

Good point. I shouldn't encode the information twice. We do want the io.compression.codecs so that it is easy to extend the list of potential codecs. I could either make io.compression.codecs a straight list of codec classes or remove the getDefaultExtension method. Thoughts?

> Should the output property be instead named mapred.text.output.compression.codec? 
> In other words, will we use this same property to name the codecs for other output formats, or is 
> this property for text files alone (in which case it should have 'text' in its name)? 

I would think that the SequenceFileOutputFormat (under HADOOP-441) should use the same property. At least that was my thought.

> I'd like TextInputFomat and TextOutputFormat to automatically compress and uncompress text files when they are read and written. Furthermore, I'd like to be able to use custom compressors as defined in HADOOP-441. Therefore, I propose:
> Adding a map of compression codecs in the server config files:
> io.compression.codecs = "<suffix>=<codec class>,..."
> so the default would be something like:
> <property>
>   <name>io.compression.codecs</name>
>   <value>.gz=org.apache.hadoop.io.GZipCodec,.Z=org.apache.hadoop.io.ZipCodec</value>
>   <description>A list of file suffixes and the codecs for them.</description>
> </property>
> note that the suffix can include multiple "." so you could support suffixes like ".tar.gz", but they are just treated as literals against the end of the filename.
> If the TextInputFormat is dealing with such a file, it:
>   1. makes a single split
>   2. decompresses automatically
> On the output side, if mapred.output.compress is true, then TextOutputFormat would use a new property mapred.output.compression.codec that would define the codec to use to compress the outputs,  defaulting to gzip.

Owen O'Malley updated HADOOP-54:
--------------------------------

    Attachment: enum-54.patch

I'm ok with the final patch, but I think that we should just go ahead and use the 1.5 enums. I made the trivial edit to do that and re-rolled the patch.

> SequenceFile will optionally compress individual values.  But both compression and performance would be much better if sequences of keys and values are compressed together.  Sync marks should only be placed between blocks.  This will require some changes to MapFile too, so that all file positions stored there are the positions of blocks, not entries within blocks.  Probably this can be accomplished by adding a getBlockStartPosition() method to SequenceFile.Writer.

A simple, easy-to-use and understand API can be constructed on top of a 
perhaps not quite-so-simple, yet more general API.  The converse is not 
always true.  So I would prefer that the input primitives, the things 
called by the system, are abstact, free of notions like file names, 
directories, positions, offsets, etc., and that such features are 
supported by library/utility code.

The case has been made that it would be good to dynamically determine 
the map function, rather than having a fixed map function for all splits 
of a job.  We already intend to make split abstract (HADOOP-451).  So it 
makes sense to make the mapper a function of the split.  Thus a given 
job's input is determined by methods like the following:

Split[] getSplits(job);
RecordReader getRecordReader(job, split);
Mapper getMapper(job, split, recordReader);

The first two are currently InputFormat methods.  The latter does not 
yet exist.

In the normal case, all mappers are instances of the same class.  When 
they're different, then then the splits will be somehow different (in 
order to indicate which mapper to use), and the record readers may also 
be different.  So whenever one uses a non-default implementation of 
getMapper() it will require coordination with the getSplits() and 
perhaps the getRecordReader() implementations.  Since they must be 
coordinated, it makes sense to combine these methods in a single 
interface, called something like JobInput.

But we don't expect end users to be implementing JobInput.  Rather, they 
might job.setJobInputClass(MultiJobInput.class) and then use a static 
utility method like:

void MultiJobInput.addInput(job, dir, recordReaderClass, mapperClass);

This will set some properties that MultiJobInput's getSplits(), 
getRecordReader() and getMapper() implementations will use.

So we can still have a simple, easy-to-use API, without hardwiring a lot 
of assumptions about input/output formats into the kernel.

Does this make sense?  Does it sound reasonable?

This sounds good to me! A couple of questions.

If the user uses the default JobInput implementation, how does the user to
specify the input directory? Currently, it is done through methods of
JobConf. Will that change?

But can the end user implement such a class if s/he wants to? In other
words, will the user have only two choices: the default implementation of
JobInput
and MultiJobInput? Or the user can implement his own:
	public class MyMultipleInput implements JobInput {
};

The default JobInput should be back-compatible.  We could decide to 
deprecate JobConf.setInputDir(), and encourage folks to use an 
JobInput-specific method.

Sure, that's the idea, to give more flexibility to those who need it.

arkady borkovsky commented on HADOOP-372:
-----------------------------------------

The issue as stated in the title is an important useful feature on it's own.

However the actual problem that motivated it, as described in the original post, does not necessarily imply the suggested solution.
The problem Runping describes looks like a case of Join to me. 
The suggested solution would help to implement a work-aorund using MapReduce.  
But is this the best way of allocating development resources?  
Implementing Join  using    MultiJobInput   in Map step  and SplitIterator  in Reduce step  is a temporary work-around solution.
Would it make sense to define interfaces in terms of actual problem (Join)?   In short term it still may be implemented piggy-backing MapReduce using two-level keys and MultiJobInput.   But the user would be able to think in more appropriate terms.

Additional splilts for last reduces?
------------------------------------

                 Key: HADOOP-484
                 URL: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-484

          Issue Type: Improvement
          Components: mapred
            Reporter: arkady borkovsky


Often last few reduces take very long.  

Would it make sense, if hardware is available, to resplit their inputs into smaller chunks and to run multiple task instead?

Michel Tourn commented on HADOOP-372:
-------------------------------------

Support for "all-pairs" joins is a far-reaching requirement that I don't touch here. 

But I agree with Doug's last comment:

>In other words, if you're going to define custom mappers anyway, 
>then it's no more work to define custom Input formats.

Moreover, unless I am missing something, the current APIs already nicely address the requirement in the JIRA issue title.

JobConf.addInputPath(Path dir)

JobConf.setInputFormat(Class theClass)

InputFormat {
  FileSplit[] getSplits(FileSystem, JobConf, preferredNumSplits)
  RecordReader getRecordReader(FileSystem fs, FileSplit split,
                               JobConf job, Reporter reporter)
  ...
}

Given this current API the flow looks like this:

During Task execution ( InputFormat.getRecordReader() ):

taks's FileSplit + job's single InputFormat  -> Path context -> inputDirectory context --> dispatched "sub" InputFormat --> getRecordReader --> RecordReader instance.


During JobTracker splits computation ( InputFormat.getSplits() ):

job's single InputFormat  + job's list of input directories --> list of input dirs/files --> list of sub-InputFormat-s --> dispatch and "aggregate" the results from your sub-InputFormat-s .getSplits()


This is enough to implement the special case discussed in the HADOOP-372 title:

InputDirectory  --> InputFormat


A framework class or the examples or the Wiki FAQ could demonstrate how one can write such a *generic* dispatching  class:


class DispatchInputFormat(InputFormat[], JobConf)   implements InputFormat


It is generic but not universal.
different applications will need to use different information to make the InputFormat dispatch / aggregation decisions.

Now three ways to customize this DispatchInputFormat.

1./3. Writing zero java code:

replace:
>job.addInputPath("foo", FooInput.class); 
with:
job.set("DispatchInputFormat.inputdirmap", "foo=org.example.FooInput bar=org.example.BarInput")

If you want client-side type checking for the classnames, do it in a helper method.
For example:

static void DispatchInputFormat.addDir(
  JobConf, Path dir, Class<InputFormat> clazz)
Call:
DispatchInputFormat.add(job, new Path("foo"), FooInput.class);
DispatchInputFormat.add(job, new Path("bar"), BarInput.class);

Where Class<InputFormat> uses Generics to enforce at compile-time that FooInput implements InputFormat. 


2./3. code reuse without copy-paste

A few well-placed hooks could allow users to reuse and customize the DispatchInputFormat code without duplicating it:

class MyInputFormat extends DispatchInputFormat {

  //override
   protected InputFormat inputDirToFormat(Path inputDir) {
     ...
   } 
}

3./3. code reuse with copy-paste

And for more complex requirements that do not fit well with inputDirToFormat():

one would instead use DispatchInputFormat as a starting point, a source code example.

> SequenceFile will optionally compress individual values.  But both compression and performance would be much better if sequences of keys and values are compressed together.  Sync marks should only be placed between blocks.  This will require some changes to MapFile too, so that all file positions stored there are the positions of blocks, not entries within blocks.  Probably this can be accomplished by adding a getBlockStartPosition() method to SequenceFile.Writer.

allow a different comparator for grouping keys in calls to reduce
-----------------------------------------------------------------

                 Key: HADOOP-485
                 URL: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-485
             Project: Hadoop
          Issue Type: New Feature
    Affects Versions: 0.5.0
            Reporter: Owen O'Malley
         Assigned To: Owen O'Malley


Some algorithms require that the values to the reduce be sorted in a particular order, but extending the key with the additional fields causes  them to be handled by different calls to reduce. (The user then collects the values until they detect a "real" key change and then processes them.)

It would be much easier if the framework let you define a second comparator that did the grouping of values for reduces. So your reduce inputs look like:

A1, V1
A2, V2
A3, V3
B1, V4
B2, V5

instead of getting calls to reduce that look like:

reduce(A1, {V1}); reduce(A2, {V2}); reduce(A3, {V3}); reduce(B1, {V4}); reduce(B2, {V5});

you could define the grouping comparator to just compare the letters and end up with:

reduce(A1, {V1,V2,V3}); reduce(B1, {V4,V5});

which is the desired outcome. Note that this assumes that the "extra" part of the key is just for sorting because the reduce will only see the first representative of each equivalence class.

------------------------------------

Ah, I didn't know it worked like this. Seems that it might be a useful feature.

But all I want is the hashing, so does HADOOP_IDENT_STRING stay in, or should it be taken out? Perhaps this should be another issue entirely?

> Configuration directories can be specified by either setting HADOOP_CONF_DIR or using the --config command line option. However, the hadoop-daemon.sh script will not start the daemons unless the PID directory is separate for each configuration.
> The issue is that the code for generating PID filenames is not dependent on the configuration directory. While the PID directory can be changed in hadoop-env.sh, it seems a little unnecessary to have this restriction.

> A job should be able to specify more than one jar file into its JobConf file because sometimes custom Map and Reduce classes or just InputFormat classes uses objects coming from other jar files. For now, we have to build a unique jar to make Hadoop mapreduce operations works.

Arun C Murthy commented on HADOOP-441:
--------------------------------------

Doug,

  If I'm not missing something here... we can reuse the compressor by having one 'Deflater/Inflater' object per Writer/Reader instead of the pool right? Even then creating the stream with the above compressor will probably be quite significant for RecordCompressWriter where we would need to do this per record? Appreciate any further details on this one.

 Also, I'm concerned this solution will be quite gzip specific, which be unsuitable for a generic 'custom' compressor... thoughts?

Arun C Murthy commented on HADOOP-441:
--------------------------------------

Wrt to the new Compression{Input|Output}Stream interfaces proposed by Owen, here are some thoughts and alternatives...

(Since then a new idea is to have the the above 'compression streams' implement the Data{Input|Output} interfaces, so that they can be passed along to the write/readFields methods of Writable objects i.e. bridge a 'stream' with Data{Input|Output})

a) 

public abstract class CompressionOutputStream extends DataOutputStream {
  public abstract int write();
  public abstract int write(byte[], int, int);
  public abstract void resetCompressionState(); // 'reset'
  public abstract void finish(); // Finishes writing compressed data to the output stream without closing the underlying stream.
}

Here we let DataOutputStream's other public methods (writeBoolean, writeInt etc.) be as-is, based on assumption that they all _will_ internally call the two abstract 'write' methods which correctly 'compress'. (Valid assumption on all jvms and on all platforms across versions?)

Since DataInputStream's 'read' is marked 'final':
public abstract class CompressionInputStream implements DataInput {
  public abstract int read();
  public abstract int read(byte[], int, int);
  public abstract void resetCompressionState(); // 'reset'

  // Other interfaces of DataInput are provided concrete implementations
}


b) 

Same CompressionInputStream but get CompressionOutputStream to implement DataOutput instead of DataOutputStream to maintain symmetry - this approach has the drawback that we will need to provide concrete implementations of other public interfaces of DataOutput; only maintaining symmetry.


c)

 To provide a 'true bridge' between streams and Writables we can create other classes:

public abstract class WritableOutputStream implements DataOutput (extends DataOutputStream) {
}

public abstract class WritableInputStream implements DataInput {
}

public class CompressionOutputStream extends  WritableOutputStream {
}

public class CompressionInputStream extends DataInput WritableInputStream {
}

 Thus it will provide a more general bridge between streams and Writables and enable other {In|Out}putStream implementations in future. (This can also be a separate issue...)


Thoughts?

> SequenceFiles should support 'custom compressors' which can be specified by the user on creation of the file. 
> Readily available packages for gzip and zip (java.util.zip) are among obvious choices to support. Of course there will be hooks so that other compressors can be added in future as long as there is a way to construct (input/output) streams on top of the compressor/decompressor.
> The 'classname' of the 'custom compressor/decompressor' could be stored in the header of the SequenceFile which can then be used by SequenceFile.Reader to figure out the appropriate 'decompressor'. Thus I propose we add constructors to SequenceFile.Writer which take in the 'classname' of the compressor's input/output stream classes (e.g. DeflaterOutputStream/InflaterInputStream or GZIPOutputStream/GZIPInputStream), which acts as the hook for future compressors/decompressors.

Benjamin Reed commented on HADOOP-281:
--------------------------------------

Have we considered this to be a feature. Some newer general purpose file system allow a file to also be a directory (and visa versa). It is an abstraction that nicely folds in the functionality of streams and resource forks. For example, rather than sticking crcs and other attributes for a file in the same directory as a file (which necessitates a bunch of ugly skip logic in the code), we could simply put them in a subdirectory of the file.

> dfs.FSDirectory.mkdirs will merrily adds children to a directory tree node without checking whether it represents a directory. So it is possible to create a subdirectories of a file.

Benjamin Reed commented on HADOOP-372:
--------------------------------------

We have a desperate need to be able to specify different inputformat classes, mappers, and partition functions in the same job. Our need roughly corresponds to this issue. However, we do not assume that a given input will need to be processed by only one inputformat, mapper, or partition function.

I think Owen was right about directing the discussion towards HADOOP-451. If HADOOP-451 was fixed, we (meaning my project) would not have any issues in this area. We actually use a similar syntax to the one proposed by Michel: job.set("DispatchInputFormat.inputdirmap", "foo=org.example.FooInput bar=org.example.BarInput"), but imagine if we get job.set("DispatchInputFormat.inputdirmap", "foo=org.example.FooInput foo=org.example.BarInput"), now foo must be processed by both FooInput and BarInput. When the splits are created and sent to the mappers, the DispatchInputFormat will get {"foo", offset, length}, but it has no way of knowing wether to apply FooInput or BarInput. With HADOOP-451 fixed, we could encode the InputFormat to use in the split.

Jean-Baptiste Quenot commented on HADOOP-366:
---------------------------------------------

In fact Owen's point is to say that you can put jars in the jar.

Is there any reason for this "hack" to unpack mapred.jar in TaskRunner and look for a "lib" directory containing jars?  Isn't that too much of magic?

Would it be a viable option to allow MapReduce tasks to take a list of jars instead?  Or is there a compelling reason to only give a single Jar?

> A job should be able to specify more than one jar file into its JobConf file because sometimes custom Map and Reduce classes or just InputFormat classes uses objects coming from other jar files. For now, we have to build a unique jar to make Hadoop mapreduce operations works.

Owen O'Malley commented on HADOOP-372:
--------------------------------------

Ok, Doug, Runping & I chatted offline over a whiteboard and here is a proposal that I believe captures something that will work:

public class InputHandler {
  public List<FileSplit> getSplits(JobConf);
  public RecordReader getRecordReader(JobConf, FileSplit);
  public Mapper getMapper(JobConf, FileSplit, RecordReader);
}

where InputHandler is a generalization of the current InputFomat. It is clearly possible to write user code then that handles multiple input directories with different RecordReaders and Mappers, but it isn't a huge jump from where we are now.

James P. White commented on HADOOP-366:
---------------------------------------

A more comprehensive approach to the issue Thomas raises is to use a format that addresses all aspects of Java program execution dependency.   The Java standard has two formats that address this in somewhat different ways:

JNLP  (Java Network Launch Protocol)
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/jws/index.html
Used by Java Web Start.  Addresses all of the Java platform execution issues, including using native code.
But this is probably not the right level for packaing MapReduce modules, but rather should be used to package Hadoop itself.

Extensions 
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/extensions/index.html
This is exactly what Thomas is asking for, and provides the format for included jars and the setting of the classpath.

http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/extensions/spec.html

Bundled Optional Packages

 The manifest for an application or optional package can specify one or more relative URLs referring to the JAR files and directories for the optional packages (and other libraries) that it needs. These relative URLs will be treated relative to the code base that the containing application or optional package JAR file was loaded from.

An application (or, more generally, JAR file) specifies the relative URLs of the optional packages (and libraries) that it needs via the manifest attribute Class-Path. This attribute lists the URLs to search for implementations of optional packages (or other libraries) if they cannot be found as optional packages installed on the host Java virtual machine*. These relative URLs may include JAR files and directories for any libraries or resources needed by the application or optional package. Relative URLs not ending with '/' are assumed to refer to JAR files. For example,

Class-Path: servlet.jar infobus.jar acme/beans.jar images/

 Multiple Class-Path headers may be specified, and are combined sequentially.

James P. White commented on HADOOP-366:
---------------------------------------

I didn't finish that thought...

I also don't think jobs should have this "external-config-file-plus-jar-file" structure.  The job should just be a jar file and the configuration contained within it.

There are several ways to do that.  The one that is the least change to the current implementation is to simply put the JobConf file (sans the mapred.jar property) in the root of the jar file.

Putting a suitable property in the manifest to tag the jar as a Hadoop job file is a good idea too, although it then opens the question of what other properties might belong there as well.

Benjamin Reed commented on HADOOP-372:
--------------------------------------

I like this proposal. Assuming that the RecordReader in getMapper is the really record reader (ie the one returned from getRecordReader) it would address HADOOP-433.

How would this interact with the ability to define a MapRunnable?

Doug Cutting commented on HADOOP-372:
-------------------------------------

> How would this interact with the ability to define a MapRunnable?

Good question.  Perhaps this interface should return a MapRunnable rather than a Mapper?

Also, note that the uses of FileSplit will be generalized to the more abstract Split by HADOOP-451.

Finally, I'd prefer the name "JobInput".  But I wonder: should we change it from InputFormat at all?  Do we intend to rename OutputFormat too?  If not, renaming this might  create more confusion in the API than it removes.

> Right now, the user can specify multiple input directories for a map reduce job. 
> However, the files under all the directories are assumed to be in the same format, 
> with the same key/value classes. This proves to be  a serious limit in many situations. 
> Here is an example. Suppose I have three simple tables: 
> one has URLs and their rank values (page ranks), 
> another has URLs and their classification values, 
> and the third one has the URL meta data such as crawl status, last crawl time, etc. 
> Suppose now I need a job to generate a list of URLs to be crawled next. 
> The decision depends on the info in all the three tables.
> Right now, there is no easy way to accomplish this.
> However, this job can be done if the framework allows to specify different inputformats for different input dirs.
> Suppose my three tables are in the following directory respectively: rankTable, classificationTable. and metaDataTable. 
> If we extend JobConf class with the following method (as Owen suggested to me):
>     addInputPath(aPath, anInputFormatClass, anInputKeyClass, anInputValueClass)
> Then I can specify my job as follows:
>     addInputPath(rankTable, SequenceFileInputFormat.class, UTF8.class, DoubleWritable.class)
>     addInputPath(classificationTable, TextInputFormat.class, UTF8,class, UTF8.class)
>     addInputPath(metaDataTable, SequenceFileInputFormat.class, UTF8.class, MyRecord.class)
> If an input directory is added through the current API, it will have the same meaning as it is now. 
> Thus this extension will not affect any applications that do not need this new feature.
> It is relatively easy for the M/R framework to create an appropriate record reader for a map task based on the above information.
> And that is the only change needed for supporting this extension.

Doug Cutting updated HADOOP-54:
-------------------------------

        Status: Resolved  (was: Patch Available)
    Resolution: Fixed

I just committed this.

Owen, when you converted things to use the Java 1.5 enum you also threw out most of the javadoc on that class.  I restored & improved this before I committed.

> SequenceFile will optionally compress individual values.  But both compression and performance would be much better if sequences of keys and values are compressed together.  Sync marks should only be placed between blocks.  This will require some changes to MapFile too, so that all file positions stored there are the positions of blocks, not entries within blocks.  Probably this can be accomplished by adding a getBlockStartPosition() method to SequenceFile.Writer.

There are other changes in this patch, seemingly unrelated to the class cast exception.  Are these intentional?  If so, can you describe them?  Thanks!

Doug Cutting commented on HADOOP-406:
-------------------------------------

The way this is currently supposed to work is that child processes log to standard output, and standard output is logged by the parent process (the task tracker).  Is that not working for you?

Longer-term, we probably do not want child processes opening log files directly.  Rather, they should be configured with a logger that, for each line logged, makes an RPC to the parent process, passing the level and log message.  Then the tasktracker can log things accordingly.

> Child JVM's don't have access to logging config system properties. When the child JVM gets launched, it doesn't inherit the Java system properties hadoop.log.dir and hadoop.log.file (which are actually based on the Bash environment variables $HADOOP_LOG_DIR and $HADOOP_LOGFILE). This means that you get no log messages from the actual map/reduce tasks that are executing.

Doug Cutting commented on HADOOP-419:
-------------------------------------

Previously different configurations and threads were permitted to use different classloaders.  After this patch, all use the same classloader.  I'm not sure that's always right.  Ideally, shouldn't Configuration.getResource() and Configuration.getClass("foo.class") be able to refer to configuration-specific resources, like the job jar?

Doug Cutting commented on HADOOP-474:
-------------------------------------

> We do want the io.compression.codecs so that it is easy to extend the list of potential codecs.

You mean, so that its easy to extend the mapping from file extension to codec, right?  Is there any other reason to enumerate codecs?

> I would think that the SequenceFileOutputFormat should use the same property.

But codec there will be noted inside the file, not in the extension, right?  And compression there can either be value-only or of blocks of keys and values.  So, even if you had a file extension, it wouldn't tell the whole story.  So I don't think the property has anything to do with SequenceFile.  So the property should proabably have 'text' in its name.

> I'd like TextInputFomat and TextOutputFormat to automatically compress and uncompress text files when they are read and written. Furthermore, I'd like to be able to use custom compressors as defined in HADOOP-441. Therefore, I propose:
> Adding a map of compression codecs in the server config files:
> io.compression.codecs = "<suffix>=<codec class>,..."
> so the default would be something like:
> <property>
>   <name>io.compression.codecs</name>
>   <value>.gz=org.apache.hadoop.io.GZipCodec,.Z=org.apache.hadoop.io.ZipCodec</value>
>   <description>A list of file suffixes and the codecs for them.</description>
> </property>
> note that the suffix can include multiple "." so you could support suffixes like ".tar.gz", but they are just treated as literals against the end of the filename.
> If the TextInputFormat is dealing with such a file, it:
>   1. makes a single split
>   2. decompresses automatically
> On the output side, if mapred.output.compress is true, then TextOutputFormat would use a new property mapred.output.compression.codec that would define the codec to use to compress the outputs,  defaulting to gzip.

misspelt DFS host name gives null pointer exception in getProtocolVersion
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

                 Key: HADOOP-487
                 URL: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-487

          Issue Type: Improvement
          Components: dfs
    Affects Versions: 0.5.0
            Reporter: Dick King


I'm trying to construct a DistributedFileSystem but I have the wrong hostname.

It doesn't work.  It throws an exception.  Fair enough.  

However, it throws a null pointer exception inside $Proxy0.getProtocolVersion, the code that checks whether we have the right protocol version, rather than giving us any exception we could understand or taking an exception in code to which we have sources so we have a way of understanding the problem.

--------------------------------

        Status: Resolved  (was: Patch Available)
    Resolution: Fixed

I just committed this.  Thanks, Wendy!

Ben: yes, it would be a feature, but a feature with many bugs.  There are lots of places in the current API that assume files are distinct from directories.  So, perhaps, in a separate issue, we could discuss adding this as a feature (and how we'd implement it on linux and windows), but, for now, the most consistent thing to do is treat it as a bug.

> dfs.FSDirectory.mkdirs will merrily adds children to a directory tree node without checking whether it represents a directory. So it is possible to create a subdirectories of a file.

Doug Cutting commented on HADOOP-366:
-------------------------------------

The rationale for keeping the config file separate from the jar was that folks might use a single big jar and then submit a sequence of jobs with different parameters, but all of whose code is in the same jar.  The system could be smart about caching the jar on nodes.  Rebuilding a jar for each job submitted seemed heavyweight to me.  In fact, that's what this bug was originally complaining about!

The lib directory is like that in war files.  So it too has a precedent in Java's standards!

> A job should be able to specify more than one jar file into its JobConf file because sometimes custom Map and Reduce classes or just InputFormat classes uses objects coming from other jar files. For now, we have to build a unique jar to make Hadoop mapreduce operations works.

Doug Cook commented on HADOOP-406:
----------------------------------

Hi, Doug.

The task trackers were definitely not logging the fetcher output until I applied and enabled this patch. Perhaps there is another bug, or something I simply misconfigured (I am rather new at this). I am running on a single MP machine; don't know if that makes any difference.

As I said, I'm agnostic about the solution, but given discussions about this on the Nutch forum,  there seem to be others who see the same problem.

> Child JVM's don't have access to logging config system properties. When the child JVM gets launched, it doesn't inherit the Java system properties hadoop.log.dir and hadoop.log.file (which are actually based on the Bash environment variables $HADOOP_LOG_DIR and $HADOOP_LOGFILE). This means that you get no log messages from the actual map/reduce tasks that are executing.

-------------------------------------

Since I don't see this, it is hard for me to guess what's going on.  Perhaps you can tell more about your installation: OS, JVM, config, etc.  Thanks.

> Child JVM's don't have access to logging config system properties. When the child JVM gets launched, it doesn't inherit the Java system properties hadoop.log.dir and hadoop.log.file (which are actually based on the Bash environment variables $HADOOP_LOG_DIR and $HADOOP_LOGFILE). This means that you get no log messages from the actual map/reduce tasks that are executing.

> We see several ways to solve this problem. First retrieve the properties "hadoop.log.dir" and "hadoop.log.file" from the mother JVM and then pass them to the child JVM as within the args parameter.
> Second would be to  access the environment variables "$HADOOP_LOG_DIR" and "$HADOOP_LOGFILE" using System.getEnv (java 1.5).
> Third there would be a more general solution. Taskrunner would resolve any environment variables it found in "mapred.child.java.opts" by lookup the value using System.getEnv().
> Eg:

Michel Tourn updated HADOOP-463:
--------------------------------

    Attachment: confvar.patch

The patch implements the variable expansion described in this issue.
There is also a junit test.

On my shared client machine I use it like this.
(${user.name} expands to the System property "michel")

<property>
  <name>tmp.base</name>
  <value>/tmp/${user.name}</value>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.name.dir</name>
  <value>${tmp.base}/hadoop/dfs/name</value>
</property>

etc.

I just committed this.  I also changed hadoop-default.xml to use this so that temporary directories now contain the user's name.  Thanks, Michel!

Owen O'Malley updated HADOOP-419:
---------------------------------

    Attachment: classloader-2.patch

ok, after chatting with doug, here is a different version.

It leaves the class loader in the Configuration, but it exposes a getClassByName method that allows a class lookup by class name rather than by attribute name.

If the thread does not have a class loader, it will use the default, which fixes the precise bug that Christian was hitting.

It also pulls all of the other places that were using the thread's class loader to find classes into the same code, based on the config. Note that some of the writeObject methods needed to have their signatures changed to pass in the config object so that it was clear what class loader should be used.

Owen O'Malley commented on HADOOP-477:
--------------------------------------

The simplest way to fix this is to make sure that the environment PATH, etc. of the account that starts the TaskTrackers is reasonable on each of the nodes.

A slightly more involved fix would be to create a config variable in the TaskTracker's config that specifies the PATH for the Tasks and have the TaskTracker set it on the child process. But that leads to a fairly slippery slope of throwing more and more process environment into the config.

> If the executables for -mapper or -reducer are well-known (grep, cat, awk), Streaming should make sure that the executable is found.
> If a script  for -mapper or -reducer are in a well-known language (.pl, .py), Streaming should  execute it  with the correct language processor.
> Reason:
> many jobs get started from machines with a different environment from that on the cluster.  
> On another hand, different clusters may have different environments.  
> Also, a user may have no access to the cluster machines.
> Because of this, a user may be unable to specify correct paths for standard commands, and correct language processors for scripts.
> Implementation:
> Stream may tailr the commands by prepending the path, or the name of language processor.  
> Another solution is to make sure that the commands are executed in a "meaningful" environment (with good $PATH, and other variables Unix users are accustomed to count upon).
> Once again, Streaming is user facing tool -- it is not a library or a hackable example that the users are to modify for their needs.  So it should work out of the box.

Owen O'Malley commented on HADOOP-477:
--------------------------------------

I should mention that there is a "standard" trick for scripts where you can't assume that the tool is in the same location on all machines where the script will run. Namely,

#!/usr/bin/env python
<... python script ...>

because the env command is always in /usr/bin and it will search the path for the command to run (in this case python). I just used python as an example, but this works for any scripting language.

> If the executables for -mapper or -reducer are well-known (grep, cat, awk), Streaming should make sure that the executable is found.
> If a script  for -mapper or -reducer are in a well-known language (.pl, .py), Streaming should  execute it  with the correct language processor.
> Reason:
> many jobs get started from machines with a different environment from that on the cluster.  
> On another hand, different clusters may have different environments.  
> Also, a user may have no access to the cluster machines.
> Because of this, a user may be unable to specify correct paths for standard commands, and correct language processors for scripts.
> Implementation:
> Stream may tailr the commands by prepending the path, or the name of language processor.  
> Another solution is to make sure that the commands are executed in a "meaningful" environment (with good $PATH, and other variables Unix users are accustomed to count upon).
> Once again, Streaming is user facing tool -- it is not a library or a hackable example that the users are to modify for their needs.  So it should work out of the box.

Owen O'Malley resolved HADOOP-484.
----------------------------------

    Resolution: Duplicate

Splitting a reduce would be difficult and error-prone while it was in progress. The standard approach for this problem is to use speculative execution to shorten the tail. It seems to be very effective.

Owen O'Malley updated HADOOP-441:
---------------------------------

    Attachment: codec.patch

This patch is just the codec interfaces that are shared between this issue and HADOOP-474. It basically creates an interface for compression codecs that can create input and output streams. The output stream extends DataOutputStream, so that it can be used for Writable. The input stream just extends the FilteredInputStream because DataInputStream declares read(byte[], int, int) to be final.

> SequenceFiles should support 'custom compressors' which can be specified by the user on creation of the file. 
> Readily available packages for gzip and zip (java.util.zip) are among obvious choices to support. Of course there will be hooks so that other compressors can be added in future as long as there is a way to construct (input/output) streams on top of the compressor/decompressor.
> The 'classname' of the 'custom compressor/decompressor' could be stored in the header of the SequenceFile which can then be used by SequenceFile.Reader to figure out the appropriate 'decompressor'. Thus I propose we add constructors to SequenceFile.Writer which take in the 'classname' of the compressor's input/output stream classes (e.g. DeflaterOutputStream/InflaterInputStream or GZIPOutputStream/GZIPInputStream), which acts as the hook for future compressors/decompressors.

Sanjay Dahiya commented on HADOOP-460:
--------------------------------------

There are 2 trivial changes in addition to Class case exception. 
- Removed JAVA_HOME check from run.sh as the script doesnt need it anymore. 
- Changed default input to ASCENDING from RANDOM, its only useful when outout needs to be compared against the input ( in case of single reduce) , its irrelevant for normal runs. 

Sorry about not describing these earlier.

Change ToolBase.doMain() to return a status code
------------------------------------------------

                 Key: HADOOP-488
                 URL: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-488
             Project: Hadoop
          Issue Type: Improvement
    Affects Versions: 0.6.0
            Reporter: Andrzej Bialecki 
             Fix For: 0.6.0


I propose to change the signature of ToolBase.doMain from this:

    public final void doMain(Configuration conf, String[] args) throws Exception;

to this:

    public final int doMain(Configuration conf, String[] args) throws Exception;

and then change main() methods of all classes that use ToolBase.doMain to call System.exit(code), where "code" is this return value from doMain(). All command-line tools, which still call main() methods of other tools, should be converted to use doMain() and return exit codes properly.

The main reason for this change is that returning varying exit codes is required for proper operation of shell scripts, especially differing between code == 0 (normal exit) and code != 0 (error exit).

Additionally, current implementation of doMain() already gets the return code, it just silently discards it (ToolBase.java:184).

Owen O'Malley commented on HADOOP-488:
--------------------------------------

It used to do this and the problem is that calling System.exit is very problematic for multi-threaded code.

In particular, what was happening was the "main" procedure (and therefore thread) finished and the ToolBase called System.exit. But there were still threads that had work left to do and they were killed mid-action.

System.exit is very dangerous in multi-threaded code and calling it in a framework class is usually a bad diea.

Michel Tourn commented on HADOOP-488:
-------------------------------------

System.exit is also bad bec. it is "non-composable": 
it gets in the way of  tools that try to run other tools in the same JVM (like ant and junit and pot. TaskRunner)

However this proposal is not about using System.exit more than before. It is about exposing additional information, should you choose to use System.exit.

Usage as before: 

use doMain() from other Java code, like integration tests. This does not call System.exit()

use main() from a top-level application that integrates with shell tools: these tools only understand status codes, not Java exceptions. This calls System.exit()

Now in both cases, the caller has access to the status code.

--------------------------------------

Ok, we want to change the parent class of CompressOutputStream to be FilteredOutputStream instead of DataOutputStream to be symmetric with the input stream.

We also should add a "finish" method on the output stream to finish the compression without closing the underlying stream.

Doug Cutting commented on HADOOP-441:
-------------------------------------

Overall this looks good.

On CompressionInputStream and CompressionOutputStream, the methods of FilterInputStream and FilterOutputStream should not repeated as abstract method.  That's overly paranoid and clutters the code, making it hard to see how this differs from a normal stream.  These should have only an abstract resetState() method and a ctor.  It seems FilterInputStream isn't buying much, perhaps it would be simpler to extend InputStream and OutputStream directly: that would give you most of what you're trying to defeat in the Filter classes.

Andrzej Bialecki  commented on HADOOP-488:
------------------------------------------

Thanks Michael, that was exactly the gist of my proposal; that's why I mentioned that all places which now incorrectly use main() methods should call instead doMain().

If there's a tool that starts worker threads and then completes the main thread, I would advocate that it should explicitly wait in its run(String[]) method until all threads complete, or a timeout occurs.

Doug Cutting updated HADOOP-483:
--------------------------------

    Status: Open  (was: Patch Available)

When I try 'ant clean test-libhdfs', I get:

test-libhdfs:
     [exec] LD_PRELOAD="/home/cutting/src/hadoop/trunk/build/libhdfs/libhdfs.so" /home/cutting/src/hadoop/trunk/build/libhdfs/hdfs_test
     [exec] Please set the environment variable $CLASSPATH!
     [exec] make: *** [test] Error 255
     [exec] Result: 2

I tried defining CLASSPATH in the test-libhdfs target, but was unable to construct a suitable one.

Doug Cutting updated HADOOP-419:
--------------------------------

        Status: Resolved  (was: Patch Available)
    Resolution: Fixed

I just committed this.  I changed NullWritable to extend Configured instead of implenting Configurable, saving a few lines of code.  Thanks, Owen!

Seperating user logs from system logs in map reduce
---------------------------------------------------

                 Key: HADOOP-489
                 URL: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-489
             Project: Hadoop
          Issue Type: Improvement
          Components: mapred
            Reporter: Mahadev konar
         Assigned To: Mahadev konar
            Priority: Minor


Currently the user logs are a part of system logs in mapreduce. Anything logged by the user is logged into the tasktracker log files. This create two issues-
1) The system log files get cluttered with user output. If the user outputs a large amount of logs, the system logs need to be cleaned up pretty often.
2) For the user, it is difficult to get to each of the machines and look for the logs his/her job might have generated.

I am proposing three solutions to the problem. All of them have issues with it -

Solution 1.
Output the user logs on the user screen as part of the job submission process. 

Merits- 
This will prevent users from printing large amount of logs and the user can get runtime feedback on what is wrong with his/her job.

Issues - 
This proposal will use the framework bandwidth while running jobs for the user. The user logs will need to pass from the tasks to the tasktrackers, from the tasktrackers to the jobtrackers and then from the jobtrackers to the jobclient using a lot of framework bandwidth if the user is printing out too much data.

Solution 2.
Output the user logs onto a dfs directory and then concatenate these files. Each task can create a file for the output in the log direcotyr for a given user and jobid.

Issues -
This will create a huge amount of small files in DFS which later can be concatenated into a single file. Also there is this issue that who would concatenate these files into a single file? This could be done by the framework (jobtracker) as part of the cleanup for the jobs - might stress the jobtracker.
 
Solution 3.
Put the user logs into a seperate user log file in the log directory on each tasktrackers. We can provide some tools to query these local log files. We could have commands like for jobid j and for taskid t get me the user log output. These tools could run as a seperate map reduce program with each map grepping the user log files and a single recude aggregating these logs in to a single dfs file.

Issues-
This does sound like more work for the user. Also, the output might not be complete since a tasktracker might have went down after it ran the job. 

Any thoughts?

Owen O'Malley commented on HADOOP-441:
--------------------------------------

The FilterInputStream & FilterOutputStream are saving a little code since they keep the field and handle flush & close. But it isn't a big deal either way.

And we absolutely need to make the write(byte, int, int) abstract because the implementation in both FilterOutputStream and OutputStream implementations are horrible. (They call write(int) byte by byte for each element of the array.) Remember, this is the bug that was causing Hadoop to buffer up the RPC commands only to send them byte by byte over the wire.

If we use OutputStream then at least write(int) is already abstract, so we don't need to worry about it. But in general, i think that as part of designing these APIs we do need to be very careful about the default implementations of these methods. Making them abstract to hide a problematic implementation is a good thing, in my opinion.

> SequenceFiles should support 'custom compressors' which can be specified by the user on creation of the file. 
> Readily available packages for gzip and zip (java.util.zip) are among obvious choices to support. Of course there will be hooks so that other compressors can be added in future as long as there is a way to construct (input/output) streams on top of the compressor/decompressor.
> The 'classname' of the 'custom compressor/decompressor' could be stored in the header of the SequenceFile which can then be used by SequenceFile.Reader to figure out the appropriate 'decompressor'. Thus I propose we add constructors to SequenceFile.Writer which take in the 'classname' of the compressor's input/output stream classes (e.g. DeflaterOutputStream/InflaterInputStream or GZIPOutputStream/GZIPInputStream), which acts as the hook for future compressors/decompressors.

Owen O'Malley commented on HADOOP-372:
--------------------------------------

Because very few users do anything with MapRunnable, I think we should just make the relevant changes to MapRunner.

Clearly, the name of the class is totally a judgment call. To me, the input "format" is the class of the RecordReader. The scope of this class is naturally much wider.

So in terms of the user interface, I would propose that the default InputMetaFormat asks the job conf for a RecordReader and a Mapper. So, there should be new JobConf methods:

// defaults to TextRecordReader
void setRecordReaderClass(Class);
Class getRecordReaderClass();

is that reasonable?

> Right now, the user can specify multiple input directories for a map reduce job. 
> However, the files under all the directories are assumed to be in the same format, 
> with the same key/value classes. This proves to be  a serious limit in many situations. 
> Here is an example. Suppose I have three simple tables: 
> one has URLs and their rank values (page ranks), 
> another has URLs and their classification values, 
> and the third one has the URL meta data such as crawl status, last crawl time, etc. 
> Suppose now I need a job to generate a list of URLs to be crawled next. 
> The decision depends on the info in all the three tables.
> Right now, there is no easy way to accomplish this.
> However, this job can be done if the framework allows to specify different inputformats for different input dirs.
> Suppose my three tables are in the following directory respectively: rankTable, classificationTable. and metaDataTable. 
> If we extend JobConf class with the following method (as Owen suggested to me):
>     addInputPath(aPath, anInputFormatClass, anInputKeyClass, anInputValueClass)
> Then I can specify my job as follows:
>     addInputPath(rankTable, SequenceFileInputFormat.class, UTF8.class, DoubleWritable.class)
>     addInputPath(classificationTable, TextInputFormat.class, UTF8,class, UTF8.class)
>     addInputPath(metaDataTable, SequenceFileInputFormat.class, UTF8.class, MyRecord.class)
> If an input directory is added through the current API, it will have the same meaning as it is now. 
> Thus this extension will not affect any applications that do not need this new feature.
> It is relatively easy for the M/R framework to create an appropriate record reader for a map task based on the above information.
> And that is the only change needed for supporting this extension.

Arun C Murthy updated HADOOP-441:
---------------------------------

    Attachment: codec_updated_interfaces_20060830.patch

+1 for using abstract methods in Compression{In|Out}putStreams to ensure correct implementations are provided.

Here's an update interface for the streams and codecs...

> SequenceFiles should support 'custom compressors' which can be specified by the user on creation of the file. 
> Readily available packages for gzip and zip (java.util.zip) are among obvious choices to support. Of course there will be hooks so that other compressors can be added in future as long as there is a way to construct (input/output) streams on top of the compressor/decompressor.
> The 'classname' of the 'custom compressor/decompressor' could be stored in the header of the SequenceFile which can then be used by SequenceFile.Reader to figure out the appropriate 'decompressor'. Thus I propose we add constructors to SequenceFile.Writer which take in the 'classname' of the compressor's input/output stream classes (e.g. DeflaterOutputStream/InflaterInputStream or GZIPOutputStream/GZIPInputStream), which acts as the hook for future compressors/decompressors.

Doug Cutting commented on HADOOP-489:
-------------------------------------

I like (3) best.

One can implement the effect of (1) by having client code poll running tasks for new log messages.  We could present logs as feeds via RSS or Atom.

An InputFormat for logs would also be great.  It could take parameters like the username, job name, jobid and task id.  Tasks could be localized to the node where the logs live.

Michel Tourn commented on HADOOP-489:
-------------------------------------

I don't know what is the best implementation.

But the normal requirements for this info are:

1. Task log data should be made available in real-time. The main point is to debug execution problems at startupt. The point is not to gather after-the-fact throughput metrics on successful jobs.
Example messages we want to see immediately (so we can kill the job):
/usr/custombin/perl : program not found
/usr/bin/perl: myscript.pl: file not found

2. Leave any log aggregation to the consumers. Aggregation gets in the way of timeliness: after the FIRST map task fails as in 1., we want to access its log. Waiting for failure-everywhere is not an acceptable alternative. (due to time delays, partial success and 3x reexecution)

3. Nice to have: access to a single Task log is as a stream, not a file or blob. 
i.e. we do not need to wait for Task termination to access its log. However this is more constraining on the implementation, and for the above use case of failure at launch it is not necessary.

Arun C Murthy commented on HADOOP-483:
--------------------------------------

 This is due to the fact that libhdfs relies on the hadoop setup to be up and running (and $CLASSPATH to be setup correctly to the running instance), which isn't the case after 'ant clean'. Should I setup the 'compile-libhdfs' target in build.xml to depend on 'package' too? (However that still won't solve the problem that hadoop isn't running when we need to run hdfs_test)

  All this while we relied on this to be done explicitly and hence the comment in build.xml which notes that test-libhdfs should be run manually.

  I'd appreciate any ideas on how to improve this further... including how I can go about ensuring that hadoop is running, setup correct classpaths (for jni) etc.

thanks,
Arun

--------------------------------------

Also, there are separate 'compile-libhdfs', 'test-libdhfs', 'clean-libhdfs' and 'package-libhdfs' targets (independent of usual hadoop targets) in build.xml to let users work only with libhdfs separately.

Doug Cutting commented on HADOOP-372:
-------------------------------------

We don't expect most users to directly implement this API, rather this is the API the system invokes.  So the core API should be MapRunnable, and the library should can provide a standard implementation (MapRunner) whose constructor takes a Mapper class.  Otherwise folks would be unable to use a different MapRunnable for each task and we'd be back where we started.

I don't think we need to add JobConf methods beyond those to access the InputFormat.  The default InputFormat will remain TextInputHandler, for back-compatibility, no?  We don't want JobConf to keep growing arbitrarily, so we should move to using static methods on library classes to access properties specific to those classes.  Thus, if one specifies an InputFormat implementation named MetaInputHandler, then the method to set the record reader would be MetaInputHandler.setRecordReaderClass(Class).

InputFormatBase will get a new method, getMapRunnable, whose default implementation is something like:

MapRunnable getMapRunnable(Split) {
  return new MapRunner(InputFormatBase.getMapperClass(getConf()));
}

JobConf.getMapperClass() should be thus deprecated and made to call InputFormatBase.getMapperClass().  So a job might:

job.setInputFormatClass(SequenceFileInputFormat.class);
SequenceFileInputFormat.setMapperClass(MyMapper.class);

> Right now, the user can specify multiple input directories for a map reduce job. 
> However, the files under all the directories are assumed to be in the same format, 
> with the same key/value classes. This proves to be  a serious limit in many situations. 
> Here is an example. Suppose I have three simple tables: 
> one has URLs and their rank values (page ranks), 
> another has URLs and their classification values, 
> and the third one has the URL meta data such as crawl status, last crawl time, etc. 
> Suppose now I need a job to generate a list of URLs to be crawled next. 
> The decision depends on the info in all the three tables.
> Right now, there is no easy way to accomplish this.
> However, this job can be done if the framework allows to specify different inputformats for different input dirs.
> Suppose my three tables are in the following directory respectively: rankTable, classificationTable. and metaDataTable. 
> If we extend JobConf class with the following method (as Owen suggested to me):
>     addInputPath(aPath, anInputFormatClass, anInputKeyClass, anInputValueClass)
> Then I can specify my job as follows:
>     addInputPath(rankTable, SequenceFileInputFormat.class, UTF8.class, DoubleWritable.class)
>     addInputPath(classificationTable, TextInputFormat.class, UTF8,class, UTF8.class)
>     addInputPath(metaDataTable, SequenceFileInputFormat.class, UTF8.class, MyRecord.class)
> If an input directory is added through the current API, it will have the same meaning as it is now. 
> Thus this extension will not affect any applications that do not need this new feature.
> It is relatively easy for the M/R framework to create an appropriate record reader for a map task based on the above information.
> And that is the only change needed for supporting this extension.

Doug Cutting commented on HADOOP-489:
-------------------------------------

Perhaps we should distinguish by log level.  Fatal (and perhaps error and warning) -level messages could be displayed immediately to the client.

We currently propagate the error message with which a task fails back to the task tracker.  Perhaps just displaying these as tasks fail would be sufficient.

> Currently the user logs are a part of system logs in mapreduce. Anything logged by the user is logged into the tasktracker log files. This create two issues-
> 1) The system log files get cluttered with user output. If the user outputs a large amount of logs, the system logs need to be cleaned up pretty often.
> 2) For the user, it is difficult to get to each of the machines and look for the logs his/her job might have generated.
> I am proposing three solutions to the problem. All of them have issues with it -
> Solution 1.
> Output the user logs on the user screen as part of the job submission process. 
> Merits- 
> This will prevent users from printing large amount of logs and the user can get runtime feedback on what is wrong with his/her job.
> Issues - 
> This proposal will use the framework bandwidth while running jobs for the user. The user logs will need to pass from the tasks to the tasktrackers, from the tasktrackers to the jobtrackers and then from the jobtrackers to the jobclient using a lot of framework bandwidth if the user is printing out too much data.
> Solution 2.
> Output the user logs onto a dfs directory and then concatenate these files. Each task can create a file for the output in the log direcotyr for a given user and jobid.
> Issues -
> This will create a huge amount of small files in DFS which later can be concatenated into a single file. Also there is this issue that who would concatenate these files into a single file? This could be done by the framework (jobtracker) as part of the cleanup for the jobs - might stress the jobtracker.
>  
> Solution 3.
> Put the user logs into a seperate user log file in the log directory on each tasktrackers. We can provide some tools to query these local log files. We could have commands like for jobid j and for taskid t get me the user log output. These tools could run as a seperate map reduce program with each map grepping the user log files and a single recude aggregating these logs in to a single dfs file.
> Issues-
> This does sound like more work for the user. Also, the output might not be complete since a tasktracker might have went down after it ran the job. 
> Any thoughts?

Andrzej Bialecki  updated HADOOP-488:
-------------------------------------

    Attachment: patch.txt

Patch that implements the return value, and changes tools to use this value as a System.exit() code. If there are no objections I'll apply this.

> I propose to change the signature of ToolBase.doMain from this:
>     public final void doMain(Configuration conf, String[] args) throws Exception;
> to this:
>     public final int doMain(Configuration conf, String[] args) throws Exception;
> and then change main() methods of all classes that use ToolBase.doMain to call System.exit(code), where "code" is this return value from doMain(). All command-line tools, which still call main() methods of other tools, should be converted to use doMain() and return exit codes properly.
> The main reason for this change is that returning varying exit codes is required for proper operation of shell scripts, especially differing between code == 0 (normal exit) and code != 0 (error exit).
> Additionally, current implementation of doMain() already gets the return code, it just silently discards it (ToolBase.java:184).

> Servers and clients (client include datanodes, tasktrackers, DFSClients & tasks) should not cache connections or maybe cache them for very short periods of time. Clients should set up & tear down connections to the servers everytime they need to contact the servers (including the heartbeats). If connection is cached, then reuse the existing connection for a few subsequent transactions until the connection expires. The heartbeat interval should be more so that many more clients (order of  tens of thousands) can be accomodated within 1 heartbeat interval.

Add ability to send "signals" to jobs and tasks
-----------------------------------------------

                 Key: HADOOP-490
                 URL: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-490
             Project: Hadoop
          Issue Type: New Feature
          Components: mapred
    Affects Versions: 0.6.0
            Reporter: Andrzej Bialecki 


In some cases it would be useful to be able to "signal" a job and its tasks about some external condition, or to broadcast a specific message to all tasks in a job. Currently we can only send  a single pseudo-signal, that is to kill a job.

Example 1: some jobs may be gracefully terminated even if they didn't complete all their work, e.g. Fetcher in Nutch may be running for a very long time if it blocks on relatively few sites left over from the fetchlist. In such case it would be very useful to send it a message requesting that it discards the rest of its input and gracefully completes its map tasks.

Example 2: available bandwidth for fetching may be different at different times of day, e.g. daytime vs. nighttime, or total external link usage by other applications. Fetcher jobs often run for several hours. It would be good to be able to send a "signal" to the Fetcher to throttle or un-throttle its bandwidth usage depending on external conditions.

Job implementations could react to these messages either by implementing a method, or by registering a listener, whichever seems more natural.

I'm not quite sure how to go about implementing it, I guess this would have to be a part of  TaskUmbilicalProtocol but my knowledge here is a bit fuzzy ... ;) Comments are welcome.

Doug Cutting commented on HADOOP-490:
-------------------------------------

The mapper could periodically poll a server for new messages.  For example, a DFS directory could be used per job with a message per file, named with a timestamp.  This would not require changes to the MapReduce system.  Would this be impractical for the fetcher application?

Andrzej Bialecki  commented on HADOOP-490:
------------------------------------------

It could address this particular problem, yes. However, each time application writers would have to design their own way to do this - it would be better if the framework provided some support for this.

> In some cases it would be useful to be able to "signal" a job and its tasks about some external condition, or to broadcast a specific message to all tasks in a job. Currently we can only send  a single pseudo-signal, that is to kill a job.
> Example 1: some jobs may be gracefully terminated even if they didn't complete all their work, e.g. Fetcher in Nutch may be running for a very long time if it blocks on relatively few sites left over from the fetchlist. In such case it would be very useful to send it a message requesting that it discards the rest of its input and gracefully completes its map tasks.
> Example 2: available bandwidth for fetching may be different at different times of day, e.g. daytime vs. nighttime, or total external link usage by other applications. Fetcher jobs often run for several hours. It would be good to be able to send a "signal" to the Fetcher to throttle or un-throttle its bandwidth usage depending on external conditions.
> Job implementations could react to these messages either by implementing a method, or by registering a listener, whichever seems more natural.
> I'm not quite sure how to go about implementing it, I guess this would have to be a part of  TaskUmbilicalProtocol but my knowledge here is a bit fuzzy ... ;) Comments are welcome.

+1 for Michel's points.

With these point in mind, solution (3) does not look attractive -- at  
least as long as the tools for immediate access to such logs are  
perfect.

I like solution (2).   Concatenation is separate issue -- the important  
thing is immediate availability.   Once the logs are written, it will  
be not to hard to provide web UI to access them.
Maybe solution (2) be modified so that the messages from all tasks go  
to the single DFS files -- each line of the logs prefixed with task ID  
and time stamp?

Doug Cutting commented on HADOOP-312:
-------------------------------------

This disables connection caching by default (and hence, everywhere, since no one yet overrides this new option).  If we really don't think we need connection caching, then the client could be radically simpler: no per-connection threads, etc.

I thought the original plan was not so much to disable all connection caching, but rather limit it to hosts that have been contacted recently.  But I see no provision in the current patch for timing out idle connections.

The incrementRef & decrementRef methods are each only called once.  In both cases the check for isCachingDisabled can be skipped.  So these can simply become inUse++ and inUse--.

Let's not add a separate config option for the connect timeout, but rather just use the normal io timeout.

Finallly, the socket close and open should not be within a synchronized(connections) block, as, that way, a slow server will block access to all servers.

> Servers and clients (client include datanodes, tasktrackers, DFSClients & tasks) should not cache connections or maybe cache them for very short periods of time. Clients should set up & tear down connections to the servers everytime they need to contact the servers (including the heartbeats). If connection is cached, then reuse the existing connection for a few subsequent transactions until the connection expires. The heartbeat interval should be more so that many more clients (order of  tens of thousands) can be accomodated within 1 heartbeat interval.

-------------------------------------

> I'd appreciate any ideas on how to improve this further... including how I can go about ensuring that hadoop is running, setup correct classpaths (for jni) etc.

>>From a shell script you could use bin/start-dfs.sh and bin/stop-dfs.sh, specyfing a config directory that's in src/c++/libhdfs.

You can specify the classpath in ant using <env name="CLASSPATH" value="..."/>.

Doug Cutting commented on HADOOP-490:
-------------------------------------

> each time application writers would have to design their own way to do this

I prefer to wait until a few application writers have done it, then generalize, rather than try to guess what is universal.  Otherwise the framework gets bloated with features that are only used by one application.

Are there other folks who need to send messages to running map and reduce tasks?

> In some cases it would be useful to be able to "signal" a job and its tasks about some external condition, or to broadcast a specific message to all tasks in a job. Currently we can only send  a single pseudo-signal, that is to kill a job.
> Example 1: some jobs may be gracefully terminated even if they didn't complete all their work, e.g. Fetcher in Nutch may be running for a very long time if it blocks on relatively few sites left over from the fetchlist. In such case it would be very useful to send it a message requesting that it discards the rest of its input and gracefully completes its map tasks.
> Example 2: available bandwidth for fetching may be different at different times of day, e.g. daytime vs. nighttime, or total external link usage by other applications. Fetcher jobs often run for several hours. It would be good to be able to send a "signal" to the Fetcher to throttle or un-throttle its bandwidth usage depending on external conditions.
> Job implementations could react to these messages either by implementing a method, or by registering a listener, whichever seems more natural.
> I'm not quite sure how to go about implementing it, I guess this would have to be a part of  TaskUmbilicalProtocol but my knowledge here is a bit fuzzy ... ;) Comments are welcome.

there should be a protocol for a map or reduce task to tell the jobtracker its alive
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                 Key: HADOOP-491
                 URL: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-491
             Project: Hadoop
          Issue Type: New Feature
          Components: mapred
            Reporter: arkady borkovsky


Currently, the jobtracker relies on task to write something to the output to know the tasks are still alive.
There is a 600 seconds timeout preset.
Some tasks spend longer that 600 seconds without any output while being perfectly healthy.

It would be good to have an API for a task to explicitly tell the jobtracker it is alive.

There are certain dangers with this protocol: e.g. a task can run a separate thread that does nothing but send "i'm alive" message.   This would be a user bug to abuse the API in such way.

--------------------------------------

I like Doug's suggestion of making available fatal warnings to the user in real time. Getting access to the tasks logs as it fails  can be made possible by providing a http url to the log file which contains the log for this task. on the client screen Would that solve your second requirement Michel?

> Currently the user logs are a part of system logs in mapreduce. Anything logged by the user is logged into the tasktracker log files. This create two issues-
> 1) The system log files get cluttered with user output. If the user outputs a large amount of logs, the system logs need to be cleaned up pretty often.
> 2) For the user, it is difficult to get to each of the machines and look for the logs his/her job might have generated.
> I am proposing three solutions to the problem. All of them have issues with it -
> Solution 1.
> Output the user logs on the user screen as part of the job submission process. 
> Merits- 
> This will prevent users from printing large amount of logs and the user can get runtime feedback on what is wrong with his/her job.
> Issues - 
> This proposal will use the framework bandwidth while running jobs for the user. The user logs will need to pass from the tasks to the tasktrackers, from the tasktrackers to the jobtrackers and then from the jobtrackers to the jobclient using a lot of framework bandwidth if the user is printing out too much data.
> Solution 2.
> Output the user logs onto a dfs directory and then concatenate these files. Each task can create a file for the output in the log direcotyr for a given user and jobid.
> Issues -
> This will create a huge amount of small files in DFS which later can be concatenated into a single file. Also there is this issue that who would concatenate these files into a single file? This could be done by the framework (jobtracker) as part of the cleanup for the jobs - might stress the jobtracker.

> Solution 3.
> Put the user logs into a seperate user log file in the log directory on each tasktrackers. We can provide some tools to query these local log files. We could have commands like for jobid j and for taskid t get me the user log output. These tools could run as a seperate map reduce program with each map grepping the user log files and a single recude aggregating these logs in to a single dfs file.

DFS files are not visible until they are closed.  So logs in DFS would 
not generally be viewable until the task is complete.

That would create an i/o bottleneck.  We don't want to be log-bound.

I really think we want to continue to log to a local file, and then 
provide easy access to this over HTTP.  What's needed are tools to: (a) 
display fatal errors as they happen; (b) use logs as MapReduce input, so 
that they can, if desired, be efficiently written to DFS for 
retrospective analysis; (c) display all messages as they occur (tail 
-f).  I have reservations about (c), since reading logs from 1000 nodes 
blended together in a single stream is not easy.  Rather, I think 
polling for the last N lines or new lines since last poll (whichever is 
smaller) would be more useful, since you'd get some context with each entry.

                 Key: HADOOP-492
                 URL: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-492
             Project: Hadoop
          Issue Type: New Feature
          Components: mapred
            Reporter: arkady borkovsky


It would be nice to have map / reduce job keep aggregated counts for arbitrary events occuring in its tasks -- the numer of records processed, the numer of exceptions of a specific type, the number of sentences in passive voice, whatever the jobs finds useful.

This can be implemented by tasks periodically sending <name, value> pairs to the jobtracker (in some implementations such messages are piggy-backed on the heartbeats), so that the job tracker stores all the latests values from each task and aggregates them on a request.  It should also make the aggregated values available at the job end.  The value for a task would be flushed when the task fails.

#491 and #490 may be related to this one.

Mahadev konar commented on HADOOP-489:
--------------------------------------

Suggestion c) tail -f would be really hard to implement given that there is already a job running. So submitting tail -f as another job is not an option since it would not be real time. Also polling for the last N lines would not be easy to do until the framework automatically keeps track of the last N lines of user logs.

Doug Cutting commented on HADOOP-441:
-------------------------------------

Let's just use InputStream and OutputStream as our base classes.  We're getting nothing from FilterInputStream and FilterOutputStream except paranoid bloat.  (Why is close() abstract but not flush()?)  Either that, or remove all the spurious abstract methods.  These substantially clutter the javadoc.

> SequenceFiles should support 'custom compressors' which can be specified by the user on creation of the file. 
> Readily available packages for gzip and zip (java.util.zip) are among obvious choices to support. Of course there will be hooks so that other compressors can be added in future as long as there is a way to construct (input/output) streams on top of the compressor/decompressor.
> The 'classname' of the 'custom compressor/decompressor' could be stored in the header of the SequenceFile which can then be used by SequenceFile.Reader to figure out the appropriate 'decompressor'. Thus I propose we add constructors to SequenceFile.Writer which take in the 'classname' of the compressor's input/output stream classes (e.g. DeflaterOutputStream/InflaterInputStream or GZIPOutputStream/GZIPInputStream), which acts as the hook for future compressors/decompressors.

Doug Cutting commented on HADOOP-489:
-------------------------------------

Couldn't last-N lines be implemented with 'exec tail'?  We could add a servlet for this, that has parameters like the user, jobid, etc.  User log files could be written into a directory hierarchy so that there's a file per task, directory per user, subdir per job.

The metrics API is designed for this:

Also, Reporter.setStatus() permits tasks to dynamically alter the string shown in the web ui (and available programatically).

> It would be nice to have map / reduce job keep aggregated counts for arbitrary events occuring in its tasks -- the numer of records processed, the numer of exceptions of a specific type, the number of sentences in passive voice, whatever the jobs finds useful.
> This can be implemented by tasks periodically sending <name, value> pairs to the jobtracker (in some implementations such messages are piggy-backed on the heartbeats), so that the job tracker stores all the latests values from each task and aggregates them on a request.  It should also make the aggregated values available at the job end.  The value for a task would be flushed when the task fails.

Michel Tourn commented on HADOOP-489:
-------------------------------------

>>About (c) and providing a http url to the log file which contains 
>>the log for this task. on the client screen 
>>Would that solve your second requirement Michel?
Yes and no. 
With access to such a URL I would not ask the uer to go browse it.
But I could have HadoopStreaming retrieve the content then stream it to the user like "tail -f". 

>polling for the last N lines would not be easy
Use HTTP Keep-Alive to do this. I.e. just keep the GET socket open and wait for this "slow webserver" to send you more lines as they get available.


Now the scalability story:
===================

when you have access to all this real-time log information, 
a "smart" client will not blindly echo everything from every Task.
It will just show you what is wrong "by example"

Assuming we have a way to do some classification of the Tasks into 
categories:
"failed", "still going" and "successfully finished":

o pick the first one in each category
o by default, ignore log URLs for the other logs
o do a merged "tail -f" with a banned on the client. "tail -f " is implemented as HTTP Keep-Alive as described. 3 HTTP sockets at most. 

Yes, all this assumes some smart-client support.

But we can easily package the code as reusable logic to be used from any user-written JobSubmitter main class. 
One of these clients is HadoopStreaming.

If a client application does not use this support code:
it is just ignoring the log URLs made available, but otherwise works as usual.

Mahadev konar commented on HADOOP-489:
--------------------------------------

Do you mean a servlet running on each of the tasktrackers? What I meant in my last comment was running a job that does exec tail or any other functionality in parallel with another job already running would be problematic since we have issues with two jobs running in parallel.

Doug Cutting commented on HADOOP-491:
-------------------------------------

There already is an API for tasks to say they're alive: Reporter.setStatus() and progress().

This may not be well documented, so perhaps this is a documentation bug?

> Currently, the jobtracker relies on task to write something to the output to know the tasks are still alive.
> There is a 600 seconds timeout preset.
> Some tasks spend longer that 600 seconds without any output while being perfectly healthy.
> It would be good to have an API for a task to explicitly tell the jobtracker it is alive.
> There are certain dangers with this protocol: e.g. a task can run a separate thread that does nothing but send "i'm alive" message.   This would be a user bug to abuse the API in such way.

hadoop dfs -report information is incorrect

          Issue Type: Bug
            Reporter: Yoram Arnon
            Priority: Minor


The information presented by hadoop dfs -report is incorrect.
In the following example, the total raw bytes are correct, the used raw bytes are incorrect and should actually be on the order of 138TB.
The total effective bytes is correct, and the actual replication factor is really a healthy 3.

yarnon@g1010:build:942>hadoop dfs  2> /dev/null -report | head
Total raw bytes: 240761579888640 (224226.69 Gb)
Used raw bytes: 35934229005360 (33466.35 Gb)
% used: 14.92%

Total effective bytes: 47093545108964 (43859.28 Gb)
Effective replication multiplier: 0.7630393703047027
-------------------------------------------------


In the following example again the total raw bytes and total effective bytes are correct, but the used raw bytes, % used and effective replication are a tad off the mark.

hadoop  dfs 2> /dev/null -report | head
Total raw bytes: 236476179599360 (220235.60 Gb)
Used raw bytes: -22028236104431 (-2.15 k)
% used: -9.31%

Total effective bytes: 55609049637201 (51789.96 Gb)

Sanjay Dahiya commented on HADOOP-239:
--------------------------------------

If we keep a single history file for jobtracker we will run into a very large history files very soon, specially when there are large number of small tasks. On the other hand if we rollover the file every day then job start and end events for longer jobs or the jobs that start on the day end will be in different log files. We will still be able to see daily activity but drilling into jobs will be a problem as we will have to look up in multiple huge file for job specifc events. 
Yoram and I discussed over IM and here is current approach. 

We maintain a master file for all jobs - this file contains only job start/finish events along with no of tasks failed at finish. If the JobTracker dies before finishing a job then we dont log number of failed taks in this file. 

For each job we create a separate history log file and this file contains task/taskattempt start and finish times along with failures if any. 

The master index is rolledover every month, and during rollover we look for all jobs that have not finished and move them to the new file and discard old jobs. The detailed history log for jobs older than a month will get deleted. 

The master index will be used to render the main JSP for job history, clicking on the job will cause corresponding job file to be loaded / parsed and displayed on respective JSPs. 

Start time of the jobtracker is used as an extra key to uniquely identify jobs since same jobids are used when jobtracker restarts. 

We will not have any host specific view of tasks in this case.

> The jobtracker's WI, keeps track of jobs executed in the past 24 hours.
> if the cluster was idle for a day (say Sunday) it drops all its history.
> Monday morning, the page is empty.
> Better would be to store a fixed number of jobs (say 10 each of succeeded and failed jobs).
> Also, if the job tracker is restarted, it loses all its history.
> The history should be persistent, withstanding restarts and upgrades.

---------------------------------------------

James you're right, using a Manifest in the JAR is th standard way of doing this, thanks for reminding.  And about parameters, we could just pick the right config file in the JAR by passing a JVM argument:

  java -Dconfig=mybigcluster -jar mapred.jar

Or even using command-line arguments:

  java -jar mapred.jar mybigcluster

> A job should be able to specify more than one jar file into its JobConf file because sometimes custom Map and Reduce classes or just InputFormat classes uses objects coming from other jar files. For now, we have to build a unique jar to make Hadoop mapreduce operations works.

          Issue Type: Bug
          Components: dfs
    Affects Versions: 0.5.0
            Reporter: Christian Kunz


After switching from 0.4.0 to 0.5.0 my scripts using the hadoop utility (mainly hadoop dfs) did not work anymore because the exit code is 0 regardless whether it is successfull or failing.
This is obviously related to Hadoop-488, but I believe that after the fix in doMain the main routine in DFSShell.java needs to call System.exit based on return code of doMain or exception thrown.

---------------------------------------

I should have looked at the patch for Hadoop-488. It takes care of this issue as well.

> This is obviously related to Hadoop-488, but I believe that after the fix in doMain the main routine in DFSShell.java needs to call System.exit based on return code of doMain or exception thrown.

Doug Cutting commented on HADOOP-366:
-------------------------------------

> a Manifest in the JAR is th standard way of doing this

I'd guess there are far more war files with jars in lib directories in the world than there are executable jar files with external jars named in the manifest.  The latter is much more fragile.

Jean-Baptiste Quenot commented on HADOOP-366:
---------------------------------------------

I hear you.  But "lib" at the root is not standard WAR, is it?

The structure is:

{code}
WEB-INF/
  |
  \__ classes
  |
  \__ lib
  |  |
  |  \__ lib1.jar
  |  |
  |  \__ lib2.jar
  |
  \__ web.xml
{code}

And in web.xml we could define a webapp listener that would be invoked upon webapp startup.

distcp defeciencies and bugs
----------------------------

                 Key: HADOOP-495
                 URL: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-495
             Project: Hadoop
          Issue Type: Bug
          Components: dfs
    Affects Versions: 0.5.0
            Reporter: Sameer Paranjpye
         Assigned To: Arun C Murthy
             Fix For: 0.6.0


distcp as currently implemented has several defeciencies and bugs which I encountered when trying to use it to import logs from HTTP servers into my local DFS cluster. In general, it is user unfriendly and does not do comprehensible error reporting. 
Here's a list of things that can be improved:

1) There isn't a man page that explains the various command line options. We should have one.
2) Malformed URLs cause a NullPointerException to be thrown with no error message stating what went wrong
3) Relative paths for the local filesystem are not handled at all
4) The schema used for HDFS URLs is dfs:// it ought to be hdfs://, 'dfs' is far to general an acronym to use in URLs
5) If a copy to the local filesystem is specified with a relative path, for instance
    ./bin/hadoop distcp dfs://localhost:8020/foo.txt foo.txt
then the job runs successfully but the file is nowhere to be seen. It looks like this gets copied to the map/reduce jobs
current working directory
6) If a copy to a dfs is specified and the namenode cannot be resolved, the job fails with an IOException, no comprehensible error message is printed
7) If an HTTP URI has a query component, it is disregarded when constructing the destination file name, for instance, if one specifies the following two URLs to be copied in a file list
  http://myhost.mydomain.com/files.cgi?n=/logs/foo.txt
  http://myhost.myfomain.com/files.cgi?n=/logs/bar.txt

a single file called 'files.cgi' is created and is overwritten by one or both source files, it's not clear which. The destination
path name should be constructed in the way that 'wget' does it, using the filename+query part of the URL, escaping characters as necessary.

8) It looks like if a list of URLs is specified in a file distcp runs a separate map reduce job for each entry in the file, why?
Seems like one could do a straight copy for local files since the task needs to run locally, followed by a single MR job that
copies HDFS and http URLs

Doug Cutting commented on HADOOP-366:
-------------------------------------

Sorry, I wasn't arguing that job jar's conform to the war file spec, rather that, if we're looking for sucessful methods of including libraries in jar files, the war file provides a good analogy, one that is more widely used than executable jars.

A job jar is not an executable jar.  It is not standalone: it always gets the hadoop classes externaly, from the environment it is loaded into.  In this way it is like a war file, which always gets servlet runtime from the servlet runner.

A job jar is not a war file: it doesn't specify servlets, include jsp pages, etc.  The reason for the WEB-INF directory in a war file is to hide these files, so that, by default, files in the war are web pages, image files, etc. to be served, unless they're in WEB-INF.

James P. White commented on HADOOP-366:
---------------------------------------

I don't think WAR layout really applies here, and I do think packaging jobs as a JAR make sense.  WAR is for an application, not a library/fragment.  The application packaging I'ld like to see for Hadoop is JNLP (Java Web Start).

For the situation where common jars are used by multiple job instances, the Extension mechanism supports job jars which are simply a configuration file and dependency(s) on application jars:

http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/extensions/spec.html#deployment

And as for job jars being executable or not, they certainly are executables from Hadoop's perspective.  And while Hadoop packaging needs its own issue, I'll point out that putting the dependencies in the job jar to launch Hadoop for the job if it is executed might be a reasonable choice.

> A job should be able to specify more than one jar file into its JobConf file because sometimes custom Map and Reduce classes or just InputFormat classes uses objects coming from other jar files. For now, we have to build a unique jar to make Hadoop mapreduce operations works.

Expose HDFS as a WebDAV store
-----------------------------

                 Key: HADOOP-496
                 URL: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-496
             Project: Hadoop
          Issue Type: New Feature
          Components: dfs
            Reporter: Michel Tourn


WebDAV stands for Distributed Authoring and Versioning. It is a set of extensions to the HTTP protocol that lets users collaboratively edit and manage files on a remote web server. It is often considered as a replacement for NFS or SAMBA

HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) needs a friendly file system interface. DFSShell commands are unfamiliar. Instead it is more convenient for Hadoop users to use a mountable network drive. A friendly interface to HDFS will be used both for casual browsing of data and for bulk import/export. 

The FUSE provider for HDFS is already available ( http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-17 )  but it had scalability problems. WebDAV is a popular alternative. 

The typical licensing terms for WebDAV tools are also attractive: 
GPL for Linux client tools that Hadoop would not redistribute anyway. 
More importantly, Apache Project/Apache license for Java tools and for server components. 
This allows for a tighter integration with the HDFS code base.

There are some interesting Apache projects that support WebDAV.
But these are probably too heavyweight for the needs of Hadoop:
Tomcat servlet: http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-4.1-doc/catalina/docs/api/org/apache/catalina/servlets/WebdavServlet.html
Slide:          http://jakarta.apache.org/slide/

Being HTTP-based and "backwards-compatible" with Web Browser clients, the WebDAV server protocol could even be piggy-backed on the existing Web UI ports of the Hadoop name node / data nodes. WebDAV can be hosted as (Jetty) servlets. This minimizes server code bloat and this avoids additional network traffic between HDFS and the WebDAV server.

General Clients (read-only):
Any web browser

Linux Clients: 
Mountable GPL davfs2  http://dav.sourceforge.net/
FTP-like  GPL Cadaver http://www.webdav.org/cadaver/

Server Protocol compliance tests:
http://www.webdav.org/neon/litmus/  
A goal is for Hadoop HDFS to pass this test (minus support for Properties)

Pure Java clients:
DAV Explorer Apache lic. http://www.ics.uci.edu/~webdav/	

WebDAV also makes it convenient to add advanced features in an incremental fashion:
file locking, access control lists, hard links, symbolic links.
New WebDAV standards get accepted and more or less featured WebDAV clients exist.

> After switching from 0.4.0 to 0.5.0 my scripts using the hadoop utility (mainly hadoop dfs) did not work anymore because the exit code is 0 regardless whether it is successfull or failing.
> This is obviously related to Hadoop-488, but I believe that after the fix in doMain the main routine in DFSShell.java needs to call System.exit based on return code of doMain or exception thrown.

Arun C Murthy updated HADOOP-441:
---------------------------------

    Attachment: codec20060831.patch

Here are the updated interfaces incorporating Doug's comments:
a) The Compression{Input|Output}Streams extend {Input|Output}Streams.
b) Only the CompressionInputStream.read(byte[], int, int) & CompressionOutputStream.write(byte[],int,int) are made 'abstract' to be safe, no other interfaces are fiddled with.

> SequenceFiles should support 'custom compressors' which can be specified by the user on creation of the file. 
> Readily available packages for gzip and zip (java.util.zip) are among obvious choices to support. Of course there will be hooks so that other compressors can be added in future as long as there is a way to construct (input/output) streams on top of the compressor/decompressor.
> The 'classname' of the 'custom compressor/decompressor' could be stored in the header of the SequenceFile which can then be used by SequenceFile.Reader to figure out the appropriate 'decompressor'. Thus I propose we add constructors to SequenceFile.Writer which take in the 'classname' of the compressor's input/output stream classes (e.g. DeflaterOutputStream/InflaterInputStream or GZIPOutputStream/GZIPInputStream), which acts as the hook for future compressors/decompressors.

Owen O'Malley commented on HADOOP-288:
--------------------------------------

Jira ate my comments again. Since I didn't realize it for a day, I'll try to reconstruct them.

They were mostly nits:

1. You add 3 new mini-cluster bring up/tear down cycles in the junit tests. It would be faster to use the same cluster with multiple jobs.
2. The fields in DistributedCache should be private instead of package local.
3. The same for the string constants in TaskTracker.
4. TaskTracker.getCacheSubdir and getJobCacheSubdir should return Path's and be package local. 
5. getJobCacheSubdir should have a String jobId as a parameter and the result should be customized for that job. Furthermore, the result should be pushed through getLocalPath so that they are spread between the local dirs. Therefore, it should be given the server's conf also.
6. runningJobs should be declared as "Map runningJobs;" instead of TreeMap. You might also consider using "Map<String, RunningJob> runningJobs;"
7. appendString should probably be promoted into StringUtils as join(String[], String).
8. the catch after the calls to launchTaskForJob should probably be rolled into the body of the method rather  than repeated.
9. MapTask.java just has space changes.
10. justPaths is public and probably should be package local (and get some java doc). 
11 getCacheArchives is kind of confusing as a name since it gets both archives and files. It should also probably not be public.

> RFC: Efficient file caching 
> (on Hadoop Task nodes, for benefit of MapReduce Tasks)
> ------------------------------------------------------
> We will start implementing this soon. Please provide feedback and improvements to this plan.
> The header "Options:" indicates places where simple choices must be made.
> Problem:
> -------
> o MapReduce tasks require access to additional out-of-band data ("dictionaries")
> This out-of-band data is:
> o in addition to the map/reduce inputs.
> o large (1GB+)
> o broadcast (same data is required on all the Task nodes)
> o changes "infrequently", in particular:
> oo it is always constant for all the Tasks in a Job. 
> oo it is often constant for a month at a time 
> oo it may be shared across team members
> o sometimes used by pure-Java MapReduce programs
> o sometimes used by non-Java MapReduce programs (using Hadoop-Streaming)
> o (future) used by programs that use HDFS and Task-trackers but not MapReduce.
> Existing Solutions to the problem:
> ---------------------------------
> These solutions are not good enough. The present proposal is to do Sol 1 with caching.
> Sol 1: Pure Hadoop: package the out-of-band data in the MapReduce Job jar file.
> Sol 2: Non  Hadoop: for each task node run rsync from single source for data.
> Sol 3: Non  Hadoop: use BitTorrent, etc.
> Sol.1 is correct but slow for many reasons:
>  The Job submitter must recreate a large jar(tar) file for every Job.
>   (The jar contains both changing programs and stable dictionaries)
>  The large Jar file must be propagated from the client to HDFS with 
>  a large replication factor. 
>  At the beginning of every Task, the Task tracker gets the job jar from HDFS 
>  and unjars it in the working directory. This can dominate task execution time.
>  
> Sol.2 has nice properties but also some problems.
>  It does not scale well with large clusters (many concurrent rsync read requests i.e. single-source broadcast)
>  It assumes that Hadoop users can upload data using rsync to the cluster nodes. As a policy, this is not allowed.
>  It requires rsync.
>  
> Sol.3 alleviates the rsync scalability problems but 
>       It is a dependency on an external system. 
>       We want something simpler and more tightly integrated with Hadoop.
>       
> Staging (uploading) out-of-band data:
> ------------------------------------
> The out-of-band data will often originate on the local filesystem of a user machine 
>  (i.e. a MapReduce job submitter)
> Nevertheless it makes sense to use HDFS to store the original out-of-band data because:
> o HDFS has (wide) replication. This enables scalable broadcast later.
> o HDFS is an available channel to move data from clients to all task machines.
> o HDFS is convenient as a shared location among Hadoop team members.
> Accessing (downloading) out-of-band data:
> ----------------------------------------
> The non-Java MapReduce programs do not have or want[1] APIs for HDFS.
> Instead these programs just want to access out-of-band data as 
>  local files at predefined paths.
> ([1] Existing programs should be reusable with no changes. 
>  This is often possible bec. communication is over stdin/stdout.)
> Job's jar file as a special case:
> --------------------------------
> One use case is to allow users to make the job jar itself cachable.
> This is only useful in cases where NOTHING changes when a job is resubmitted
>  (no MapRed code changes and no changes in shipped data)
> This situation might occur with an 'extractor' job (gets data from an external source: like Nutch crawler)
> Currently the Hadoop mapred-jar mechanism works in this way:
>  the job jar data is unjarred in the "working directory" of the Task 
>  the jar contains both MapRed java code (added to classpath)
> Cache synchronization:
> ---------------------
> The efficient implementation of the out-of-band data distribution
> is mostly a cache synchronization problem.
> A list of the various aspects where choices must be made follows.
> Cache key:
> ---------
> How do you test that the cached copy is out-of-date?
> Options: 
> 1. the archive/file timestamp 
> 2. the MD5 of the archive/file content
> Comparing source and destination Timestamps is problematic bec. it assumes synchronized clocks.
> Also there is no last-modif metadata in HDFS (for good reasons, like scalability of metadata ops)
> Timestamps stored with the source ('last-propagate-time') do 
>  not require synchronized clocks, only locally monotonic time. 
> (and the worse which can happen at daylight-savings switch is a missed update or an extra-update)
> The cache code could store a copy of the local timestamp 
> in the same way that it caches the value of the content hash along with the source data.
>  
> Cachable unit:
> -------------
> Options: individual files or archives or both.
> Note:
> At the API level, directories will be processed recursively 
> (and the local FS directories will parallel HDFS directories)
> So bulk operations are always possible using directories.
> The question here is whether to handle archives as an additional bulk mechanism.
> Archives are special because:
> o unarchiving occurs transparently as part of the cache sync
> o The cache key is computed on the archive and preserved although 
>   the archive itself is not preserved.
> Supported archive format will be: tar (maybe tgz or compressed jar)
> Archive detection test: by filename extension ".tar" or ".jar"
> Suppose we don't handle archives as special files:
> Pros:
>  o less code, no discussion about which archive formats are supported
>  o fine for large dictionary files. And when files are not large, user may as well
>    put them in the Job jar as usual.
>  o user code could always check and unarchive specific cached files
>    (as a side-effect of MapRed task initialization)
> Cons:
>  o handling small files may be inefficient 
>   (multiple HDFS operations, multiple hash computation, 
>    one 'metadata' hash file along with each small file)
>  o It will not be possible to handle the Job's jar file as a special case of caching 
> Cache isolation: 
> ---------------
> In some cases it may be a problem if the cached HDFS files are updated while a Job is in progress:
> The file may become unavailable for a short period of time and some tasks fail.
> The file may change (atomically) and different tasks use a different version.
> This isolation problem is not addressed in this proposal.
> Standard solutions to the isolation problem are:
> o Assume that Jobs and interfering cache updates won't occur concurrently.
> o Put a version number in the HDFS file paths and refer to a hard-coded version in the Job code.
> o Before running the MapRed job, run a non-distributed application that tests
>   what is the latest available version of the out-of-band data. 
>   Then make this version available to the MapRed job.
>   Two ways to do this. 
>   o either set a job property just-in-time:
>     addCachePathPair("/mydata/v1234/", "localcache/mydata_latest"); 
>     (see Job Configuration for meaning of this)
>   o or publish the decision as an HDFS file containing the version.
>     then rely on user code to read the version, and manually populate the cache:
>     Cache.syncCache("/hdfs/path/fileordir", "relative/local/fileordir");
>     (see MapReduce API for meaning of this)
> Cache synchronization stages:
> ----------------------------
> There are two stages: Client-to-HDFS and HDFS-to-TaskTracker
> o Client-to-HDFS stage.
> Options: A simple option is to not do anything here, i.e. rely on the user.
> This is a reasonable option given previous remarks on the role of HDFS:
>  HDFS is a staging/publishing area and a natural shared location.
> In particular this means that the system need not track 
> where the client files come from.
> o HDFS-to-TaskTracker:
> Client-to-HDFS synchronization (if done at all) should happen before this.
> Then HDFS-to-TaskTracker synchronization must happen right before 
> the data is needed on a node.
> MapReduce cache API:
> -------------------
> Options:
> 1. No change in MapReduce framework code:
> require the user to put this logic in map() (or reduce) function:
>  in MyMapper constructor (or in map() on first record) user is asked to add:
>  
>     Cache.syncCache("/hdfs/path/fileordir", "relative/local/fileordir");
>     Cache.syncCache("..."); //etc.
>   
> -----
> 2. Put this logic in MapReduce framework and use Job properties to
>    communicate the list of pairs (hdfs path; local path)
>  
> Directories are processed recursively.
> If archives are treated specially then they are unarchived on destination.
>  
> MapReduce Job Configuration:
> ---------------------------
> Options:
> with No change in MapReduce framework code (see above)
>  no special Job configuration: 
>    it is up to the MapRed writer to configure and run the cache operations.
> ---
> with Logic in MapReduce framework (see above)
>  some simple Job configuration
> JobConf.addCachePathPair(String, String)
> JobConf.addCachePathPair("/hdfs/path/fileordir", "relative/local/fileordir");

Owen O'Malley commented on HADOOP-492:
--------------------------------------

I would propose that the JobConf defines a list of counters that is augmented with the "generic" ones like records, bytes, etc. The TaskTracker heart beat then pushes a list of longs with the status of each task as part of the heartbeats. These counters are visible as the job runs via the web/ui.

So it would look like:
  job.setCounterList("foo,bar,baz");

the Reporters pick up a new field:
   void addCounter(String counterName, long increment);

> It would be nice to have map / reduce job keep aggregated counts for arbitrary events occuring in its tasks -- the numer of records processed, the numer of exceptions of a specific type, the number of sentences in passive voice, whatever the jobs finds useful.
> This can be implemented by tasks periodically sending <name, value> pairs to the jobtracker (in some implementations such messages are piggy-backed on the heartbeats), so that the job tracker stores all the latests values from each task and aggregates them on a request.  It should also make the aggregated values available at the job end.  The value for a task would be flushed when the task fails.
> #491 and #490 may be related to this one.

Doug Cutting commented on HADOOP-441:
-------------------------------------

CompressionInputStream overrides mark(), markSupported() and reset() with implementations that are identical to those of its superclass.  These can be removed, no?  close() should probably also be defined to call in.close().

CompressionOutputStream should define close() and flush() to call in.close() and in.flush(), respectively.

I still think the abstract methods are just noise.  These are performance optimizations.  A correct codec can be implemented w/o overriding these methods.  We have seen performance issues when these are not overridden and the underlying stream is unbuffered, causing a system call to be invoked for each call.  But that won't happen in this case.  Here we'd only force a method call per byte to be compressed, which is probably the way the compressor will operate anyway (byte-at-a-time).  A method call is very different than a system call.

> SequenceFiles should support 'custom compressors' which can be specified by the user on creation of the file. 
> Readily available packages for gzip and zip (java.util.zip) are among obvious choices to support. Of course there will be hooks so that other compressors can be added in future as long as there is a way to construct (input/output) streams on top of the compressor/decompressor.
> The 'classname' of the 'custom compressor/decompressor' could be stored in the header of the SequenceFile which can then be used by SequenceFile.Reader to figure out the appropriate 'decompressor'. Thus I propose we add constructors to SequenceFile.Writer which take in the 'classname' of the compressor's input/output stream classes (e.g. DeflaterOutputStream/InflaterInputStream or GZIPOutputStream/GZIPInputStream), which acts as the hook for future compressors/decompressors.

-------------------------------------

Isn't this redundant with the metrics API?  Why do we need both?

Milind Bhandarkar commented on HADOOP-492:
------------------------------------------

We need separate global counters because there is no way to programmatically add new metrics to the TaskMetrics class, which will (after I resubmit my TaskMetrics patch) be accumulated in JobTracker via heartbeats. OTOH, TaskMetrics could be implemented in terms of global counters.

Owen O'Malley commented on HADOOP-492:
--------------------------------------

In a lot of ways, this is a weaker form of HADOOP-48. The advantage of counters is that it is clear how to aggregate them across tasks to form a count for the entire job. We could do:

public class JobCounters implements Writable {
  <methods to get/set generic counters for records/bytes, whatever>
  public void add(JobCounters other);
}

and in JobConf:
  public set/getJobCounterClass(...);

and in Reporter add:
  public JobCounters getJobCounters();

and the JobCounter is sent up as part of the heartbeat.

> When we feed an overlong string to the UTF8 constructor, two suboptimal things happen.
> First, we truncate to 0xffff/3 characters on the assumption that every character takes three bytes in UTF8.  This can truncate strings that don't need it, and it can be overoptimistic since there are characters that render as four bytes in UTF8.
> Second, the code doesn't actually handle four-byte characters.
> Third, there's a behavioral discontinuity.  If the string is "discovered" to be overlong by the arbitrary limit described above, we truncate with a log message, otherwise we signal a RuntimeException.  One feels that both forms of truncation should be treated alike.  However, this issue is concealed by the second issue; the exception will never be thrown because UTF8.utf8Length can't return more than three times the length of its input.
> I would recommend changing UTF8.utf8Length to let its caller know how many characters of the input string will actually fit if there's an overflow [perhaps by returning the negative of that number] and doing the truncation accurately as needed.

Gang,

Here's a patch I made recently that changes the behavior of dfs -rm 
so that it moves the target fille/folder into a trash folder 
(appending a timestamp) instead of deleting it. There is also a new 
dfs -emptyTrash to empty the trash (after confirming with the user). 
I sleep easier with this in place to prevent me from accidently 
deleting my entire crawl directory.

Enjoy,

- Chris

Hairong Kuang updated HADOOP-414:
---------------------------------

    Attachment: utf2text.patch

This is a partial patch to the problem including changes to packages mapred, ipc, and test.

The dfs is kept untouched. It is not trival to keep dfs  backwards compatible because writables are not versioned. Will work on it later on.

> replace class UTF8 with class Text

DataNodes and TaskTrackers should be able to report hostnames and ips relative to customizable network interfaces and nameservers
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                 Key: HADOOP-497
                 URL: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-497
             Project: Hadoop
          Issue Type: New Feature
          Components: dfs, mapred, util
    Affects Versions: 0.6.0
            Reporter: Lorenzo Thione
            Priority: Minor
         Attachments: dnsjava-2.0.2.jar, nif-utils.patch

This patch allows for network configuration parameters to be aded to the hadoop-site.xml file. These parameters specify a network interface name and an optional nameserver hostname which DataNodes and TaskTrackers consult to resolve  their hostnames from the IP bound to the specified network interface.

This is useful when machines that are part of different physical or logical network need to participate in hadoop clusters as client nodes. The hostname and IP reported by InetAddress.getLocalHost() are not necessarily the ones that will allow the JobTracker and NameNode to reach the clients, as well as not necessarily the ones through which the DFS clients can reach the DataNodes.

The configuration parameters are
 - cluster.report.nif
 - cluster.report.ns

nif: takes the name of a network interface, like en0, en1 (on macs), eth0, etc...
ns: the host name of a DNS server to use when resolving the IP bound to the specified nif

These parameters are set by default to the value "default" which will replicate the current behavior of reporting InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostName() and getHostAddress()

As part of the patch, a new library dnsjava was added along with its license information (BSD license). The list of affected files is:

src
 org.apache.hadoop.dfs.DataNode 
 org.apache.hadoop.mapred.taskTracker 
 org.apache.hadoop.util.NetworkUtils
conf
 hadoop-default.xml
lib
 dnsjava-2.0.2.jar
 dnsjava-2.0.2.LICENSE.txt

Owen O'Malley commented on HADOOP-441:
--------------------------------------

I agree with Doug about the mark, markSupported and reset on CompressionInputStream.

I also agree with Doug about having close and flush on CompressionOutputStream close and flush the out stream.

I disagree that the read/write(byte[], int, int) methods are harmless. It is easy to imagine that other codecs will go through jni, like the java.util.zip compressors do. Calling through jni to compress or decompress a byte will likely be really painful. So, yes, it is _just_ a performance concern. But without it, it is very easy to forget to handle the multi-byte case and let it default to a very bad default implementation.

Finally, I think I would make the in/out fields in Compression*Stream as "final" and not "volatile" since it will match the usage and let the optimizer do a far better job.

> SequenceFiles should support 'custom compressors' which can be specified by the user on creation of the file. 
> Readily available packages for gzip and zip (java.util.zip) are among obvious choices to support. Of course there will be hooks so that other compressors can be added in future as long as there is a way to construct (input/output) streams on top of the compressor/decompressor.
> The 'classname' of the 'custom compressor/decompressor' could be stored in the header of the SequenceFile which can then be used by SequenceFile.Reader to figure out the appropriate 'decompressor'. Thus I propose we add constructors to SequenceFile.Writer which take in the 'classname' of the compressor's input/output stream classes (e.g. DeflaterOutputStream/InflaterInputStream or GZIPOutputStream/GZIPInputStream), which acts as the hook for future compressors/decompressors.

Doug,

Would it make sense to create separate components in jira for the
applications that run on top of hadoop, augmenting dfs, mapred, io etc.?
I'm refering to streaming and distcp for starters, perhaps dfsshell too, and
maybe other components in the future.
It will facilitate tracking issues that relate to these components, that are
somewhat external to the core of hadoop.

Yoram

Apologies, contrib/streaming is already there.
So just distcp for now, optionally dfsshell.

          Issue Type: Improvement
          Components: dfs
            Reporter: Yoram Arnon


on a good size dfs, with a few 100000 blocks, fsck takes around 30 minutes, while dfs -du takes only a couple of seconds.
fsck should take seconds, rather than minutes. It should be a namenode operation, not a client program.

-------------------------------

    Component/s: contrib/streaming
                     (was: mapred)
    Description: 
The jobtracker relies on task to send heartbeats  to know the tasks are still alive.
There is a 600 seconds timeout preset.
hadoop streaming also uses output from the program it spawns to indicate progress, sending appropriate heartbeats.
Some spawned programs spend longer that 600 seconds without any output while being perfectly healthy.

It would be good to enhance the interface between hadoop streaming and the programs it spawns to track a healthy program in the absense of output.

There are certain dangers with this protocol: e.g. a task can run a separate thread that does nothing but send "i'm alive" message.   This would be a user bug to abuse the API in such way.

Currently, the jobtracker relies on task to write something to the output to know the tasks are still alive.
There is a 600 seconds timeout preset.
Some tasks spend longer that 600 seconds without any output while being perfectly healthy.

It would be good to have an API for a task to explicitly tell the jobtracker it is alive.

There are certain dangers with this protocol: e.g. a task can run a separate thread that does nothing but send "i'm alive" message.   This would be a user bug to abuse the API in such way.

> Normally that's a good thing, alerting the administrator that something's corrupted.
> An option to ignore those entries is useful for recovering from such a condition. Anyone but a hard core developer would be helpless in the face of a corruption like that, and would prefer to lose a couple of records and be able to run than to be down, or remove the entire state of dfs.

> I recently had a few nodes go bad, such that they were inaccessible to ssh, but were still running their java processes.
> tasks that executed on them were failing, causing jobs to fail.
> I couldn't stop the java processes, because of the ssh issue, so I was helpless until I could actually power down these nodes.
> restarting the cluster doesn't help, even when removing the bad nodes from the slaves file - they just reconnect and are accepted.
> while we plan to avoid tasks from launching on the same nodes over and over, what I'd like is to be able to prevent rogue processes from connecting to the masters.
> Ideally, the slaves file will contain an 'exclude' section, which will list nodes that shouldn't be accessed, and should be ignored if they try to connect. That would also help in configuring the slaves file for a large cluster - I'd list the full range of machines in the cluster, then list the ones that are down in the 'exclude' section

Owen O'Malley commented on HADOOP-488:
--------------------------------------

This patch is ok since the System.exit is being called from the main instead of ToolBase. It certainly is important that dfs shell and dist cp return exit codes when they fail. I'd even be ok with having the System.exit be in ToolBase, if it was only called on failure. Basically, the end of doMain would have:

if (result != 0) {
  System.exit(result);
}

Andrzej Bialecki  commented on HADOOP-488:
------------------------------------------

That wouldn't do - some tools may call several doMain()-s in sequence, and check their return codes, and act appropriately without exiting the JVM.

IMHO it's better to leave it as it is in the current patch, and handle System.exit in each tool's main method.

We already have a Jira category for streaming (contrib/streaming).

All categories (except "documentation") correspond to Java packages.  So 
CopyFiles issues should be in the "util" category, until we decide to 
move CopyFiles to another package (fs?).  DfsShell is in the dfs 
package, so its bugs should go in the dfs component.  Perhaps dfs should 
be broken into sub-packages.

I think this is a good approach, as it should help to encourage us to 
keep a well-structured package tree.  If something deserves a separate 
issue category, then it probably deserves a separate package.  Util is 
the most abused package.  I think it should only have stuff that's 
analagous to the stuff in java.util--generic datastructures, etc.  But 
it currently has a mish-mash of stuff, including some fs stuff (like 
CopyFiles and DiskChecker).

Javadoc also facilitates per-package documentation, by placing a 
package.html in the source tree.  Thus a well-organized package tree 
also facilitates well-organized documentation.

Hi all,

to increase productivity in our current project (which makes a heavy use 
of Hadoop), I wrote a small Eclipse-based GUI application which 
basically consists in 2 views:

    *  a HDFS explorer adapted from Eclipse filesystem explorer example.
      For now, it includes the following features:
          o classical tree-based browsing interface, with directory
            content being detailed in a 3 columns table (file name, file
            size, file type)
          o refresh button
          o delete file or directory (with confirm dialog): select files
            in the tree or table and click the "Delete" button
          o rename file or directory: simple click on the file in the
            table, type the new name and validate
          o open file with system editor: select the file in the table
            and click "Open" button (works on Windows, not on Linux)
          o internal drag & drop
          o external drag & drop from the local filesystem to the HDFS
            (the opposite doesn't work)

    * a MapReduce *very* simple job launcher:
          o select the job XML configuration file
          o run the job
          o kill the job
          o visualize map and reduce progress with progress bars
          o open a browser on the Hadoop job tracker web interface

Do you see any interest for such a tool in Hadoop (or in a connate 
project)? If yes, I see no problem contributing it. However I don't know 
what is your current thinking about providing Hadoop with some GUI 
functions? Indeed it may overlap with the current Web-based interface.

WDYT?


Fred

Doug Cutting commented on HADOOP-492:
-------------------------------------

For the third time: why can't we use the Metrics API here?  This is precisely the sort of thing it was designed for, no?

Milind says, "there is no way to programmatically add new metrics to the TaskMetrics class".  Okay, so we shouldn't use TaskMetrics for this.  But shouldn't we use a MetricsRecord?

If we use MetricsRecord to collect metrics, then we need to decide how to aggregate these.  We could use Ganglia, or we could aggregate over heartbeats, having the JobTracker and TaskTracker implement a MetricsContext.

> It would be nice to have map / reduce job keep aggregated counts for arbitrary events occuring in its tasks -- the numer of records processed, the numer of exceptions of a specific type, the number of sentences in passive voice, whatever the jobs finds useful.
> This can be implemented by tasks periodically sending <name, value> pairs to the jobtracker (in some implementations such messages are piggy-backed on the heartbeats), so that the job tracker stores all the latests values from each task and aggregates them on a request.  It should also make the aggregated values available at the job end.  The value for a task would be flushed when the task fails.
> #491 and #490 may be related to this one.

Doug Cutting commented on HADOOP-414:
-------------------------------------

It would be nice if RPC.Invocation were versioned, since you've changed its format.  Old clients talking to new servers (and vice versa) will fail.  It would be nice if these failures were accompanied by version-mismatch exceptions.

What if we start sending #xFF at the start of an Invocation as the version?  The first thing read by the old code is the method name, a UTF8.  So if old client code talks to a new daemon, then, unless the method name has 2^16-1 characters, we could log a version-mismatch and close the connection.  With a bit more work, we could even construct a version-mismatch error (using UTF8) that the client could read.

If new client code talks to an old server, the old server would try to read a method name with 2^16-1 bytes, log an EOF error and close the connection.  Is that acceptable?

Or should we punt on this?

> The streaming code internally reads the input data into a UTF8 .  This causes truncated data to be shipped to the mapper when the input exceeds about 21000 characters, with no notice to the user except possibly in individual tasks' machines' logs, which people would not normally read for apparently successful jobs.

Doug Cutting commented on HADOOP-497:
-------------------------------------

I'm not sure why you need the dnsjava library.  At a glance, it seems you could instead set sun.net.spi.nameservice.nameservers and then use the java.net.NetworkInterface to find which hostnames correspond to a particular interface.  Why doesn't that work?

A few nits with the code:

- It should probably be named net/DNS.java, insead of util/NetworkUtils.java.  The util package is already a mess.

- The descriptions of the new config properties only mention tasktracker and jobtracker, but the options are also valid for datanode and namenode.  I would also name these properties something like net.dns.interface and net.interface.nameserver.

- The new class and all its public members should have informative javadoc comments.  if we add a new package, it should have a package.html with at least a one-line description of the package.

> This patch allows for network configuration parameters to be aded to the hadoop-site.xml file. These parameters specify a network interface name and an optional nameserver hostname which DataNodes and TaskTrackers consult to resolve  their hostnames from the IP bound to the specified network interface.
> This is useful when machines that are part of different physical or logical network need to participate in hadoop clusters as client nodes. The hostname and IP reported by InetAddress.getLocalHost() are not necessarily the ones that will allow the JobTracker and NameNode to reach the clients, as well as not necessarily the ones through which the DFS clients can reach the DataNodes.
> The configuration parameters are
>  - cluster.report.nif
>  - cluster.report.ns
> nif: takes the name of a network interface, like en0, en1 (on macs), eth0, etc...
> ns: the host name of a DNS server to use when resolving the IP bound to the specified nif
> These parameters are set by default to the value "default" which will replicate the current behavior of reporting InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostName() and getHostAddress()
> As part of the patch, a new library dnsjava was added along with its license information (BSD license). The list of affected files is:
> src
>  org.apache.hadoop.dfs.DataNode 
>  org.apache.hadoop.mapred.taskTracker 
>  org.apache.hadoop.util.NetworkUtils
> conf
>  hadoop-default.xml

This sounds like it might make a good contrib module.  Please submit a 
"new feature" issue and attach it as a patch.

Thanks!

When it's time to write a new state it writes it to node 1. The state includes a generation number, a single byte starting at 0, to enable the name server to identify the valid state. A CRC is written at the end of the block to mark its validity and completeness. The log file is identified by the same generation number as the state it relates to. 
> 4.	The log file will be limited to a single block as well. When that block fills up a new state is written. 32MB of transaction logs should suffice. If not, we could set aside a set of blocks, and set aside a few locations in the super-block (block 0/1) to store that set of block ids.

----------------------------------------

Is this issue still pertinent? We have an fsck utility and TestDFSIO has been committed via a separate JIRA issue.

> Dfs needs a validation operation similiar to fsck, so that we get to know the files that are corrupted and which data blocks are missing.
> Dfs namenode also needs to log more specific information such as which block is replication or is deleted. So when something goes wrong, we have a clue what has happened.

> Several issues.
> 1. DFS commandline does not support rmdir
> 2. When executing a command like dfs -rmdir PATH, it goes through silently, without warning that -rmdir is not supported
> 3. DFS -rm PATH works even though PATH is a non-empty directory, which is inconsistent with unix convention.

Bryan Pendleton commented on HADOOP-95:
---------------------------------------

I think Eric's comment (http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-95#action_12371188) is still important. But, probably a new issue to bring up. Ongoing validation/balancing/etc. are still problems - the "fsck" utility just covers the top-level problem.

> Dfs needs a validation operation similiar to fsck, so that we get to know the files that are corrupted and which data blocks are missing.
> Dfs namenode also needs to log more specific information such as which block is replication or is deleted. So when something goes wrong, we have a clue what has happened.

> We've been having problems where the task tracker is destabilizing HDFS by filling disks and then releasing them.  Various tasks can also interfere with each other this way.
> We should have a configurable max working space for a task (and allow the setting of lower per task limits).  The task tracker should track use against this limit and terminate a job if it overruns it.

Avoid the use of Strings to improve the  performance of hadoop streaming
------------------------------------------------------------------------

                 Key: HADOOP-499
                 URL: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-499
             Project: Hadoop
          Issue Type: Improvement
          Components: contrib/streaming
    Affects Versions: 0.5.0
            Reporter: Hairong Kuang
         Assigned To: Hairong Kuang
             Fix For: 0.6.0


In hadoop streaming, a record is represented as a String for  I/O and is encoded as UTF8 for map/reduce. A record has to be converted between String and UTF8 back and forth multiple times and  this wastes CPU time.

Doug Cutting commented on HADOOP-29:
------------------------------------

Wouldn't it be simpler to just add a default constructor to Configured?

> The Nutch parse command fails, because the ParseSegment class has no default constructor.
> However, ParseSegment extends Configured, so it can be directly instanciated with a Configuration parameter.
